Kurds and urban Sunni Arabs aren\u2019t being mistreated simply for being Sunni. It\u2019s more about class than religion.""It\u2019s not a name change. They\u2019re the exact same thing (\u201cwhite hill\u201d), just in Arabic and Kurdish. Both are used in this tweet, and Kurds were a sizable minority (2nd largest after Arabs) in the town and surrounding areas until they were ethnically cleansed by ISIS and Nusra, with the help of Ahrar al-Sham and several Turkish-backed \u201cFSA\u201d groups, between mid-2013 and early 2014.""Thousands of rebels who took up arms and fought against the government for years were able to be reconciled and joined the SAA overnight. It is within the interests of the government to stir tensions between Arabs and Kurds in favour of the former.

The fact that Chechen fighters killed a native Syrian boy in his own shop makes it even more revolting. After the murder Syrian revolutionary groups in Aleppo immediately appealed and demanded other rebel factions to bring those involved to justice, but obviously nothing happened as these factions were not ready to turn against their ISIS \u201cbrothers\u201d yet.""Keep in mind that the term \u201cmilitia\u201d tends to have a negative connotation in Arabic, at least in this conflict. Pro-rebel sources like this often call the SAA and SDF \u201cmilitias\u201d, while unironically referring to their preferred rebel groups as \u201cbrigades\u201d, \u201cdivisions\u201d, and \u201ccorps\u201d of a \u201cnational army\u201d and an actual military force.""The co-head of the Raqqa Civil Council, Laila Mustafa, is a Raqqawi who was born and raised in Raqqa city, having lived there most of her life until the ISIS takeover.

He did because he won/bought the support of the locals and tribal elders.\n\nOr maybe the SAA won due to their overwhelmingly superior manpower from both themselves and numerous militias, weaponry, and Russian air support? By your logic the SDF couldn\u2019t possibly have taken Raqqa and northern Deir ez-Zor due to their lack of tribal support (a questionable statement by itself). \n\nTribes in the region  aren\u2019t monoliths. Statements on social media by a few alleged tribal representatives doesn\u2019t mean literally all tribes turned against the SDF. Among the very tribes listed in these statements, there are members enlisted in the SDF, SAA, TFSA, and so on; some have probably already fought each other.""Since the start of their campaign in mid-2012, the YPG, surrounded by hostile powers from all sides, already made enemies with and fought against almost every other armed group, and not only survived, but made some gains for 2 years without US or any other state support. Having gained numerous more allies than enemies since then, they\u2019re currently in a better position than ever.""&gt; No. (Also, the YPG took Raqqa only after USAF completely destroyed it and ISIS showed only little resistance after Kobane, with some notable exceptions.\n\nThe same thing applies for SAA gains, just replace the USAF with the RFAF, SAAF, and SAA artillery.\n\nRegarding these alleged anti-SDF tribal figures, judging by their statements I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not huge fans of Assad\u2019s government either.\n\n&gt; i have been talking a long time about tribal society turning more and more against YPG. This is just another brick in that wall.\n\nA couple of statements on social media doesn\u2019t really prove anything. Of course some people from these tribes are opposed to the YPG, but there\u2019s no evidence this sentiment is widespread and unanimous among \u201ctribal society\u201d in general.""They\u2019re most likely mixed, with the YPG/J leading the offensive on the frontlines while the DeZMC, which has more fighters (albeit lower-quality ones), reinforce them and man the rear lines.""As I said they are still mixed. There are DeZMC fighters on the front and YPG/J fighters on the rear. During the ISIS counterattack the majority of killed and captured SDF fighters appeared to be from the DeZMC.""Its pretty common standard operational procedure not to verify where special forces are deployed. ""I agree that its pretty pointless, but it does put them on notice that if they were to travel to France, or some other country that would extradite them to France for trial that they might be arrested.

""Seems more like warning shots than something they'd actually act on.

Or is it just fluff to campaign on a \"We're tough on troublemakers\" angle?""Some people seriously claimed that the YPG killed him. But yeah, ISIS is almost certainly the culprit here.""Turkey is far more likely.""The battle to take Raqqa involved a large variety of SDF groups and included many fighters from the city itself. The YPG/J still took the lead due to their larger numbers and well-organized, effective fighters, but the contributions of other groups shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. After several months of military occupation, the city\u2019s administration was handed over to a council made up of mostly Raqqawis. The council oversees a security force, which also consists of locals.\n\nTL;DR: Yes""Removed: [Repost](https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/9ug6ym/usturkish_ties_may_be_cut_for_good_in_syria)""Also to add that ISIS fighters that have been pushed back into the area/retreated there are battle-hardened, and diehard believers in the cause ISIS prorogates. If you were a conscripted fighter being forced to fight with them, and had a chance to leave, or surrender, you more than likely would have. Add that on top of your other points and it really is an uphill battle for the SDF to win the day.    ""Yes and yes.\n\nActual, minor tensions only began in 2017. Despite all those claiming that a huge outbreak of infighting will begin soon since then, relations between HTS and \u201cAQ loyalists\u201d remain good on the ground.""Speaking of this, the PKK is not much different from the various anti-Nazi insurgent groups (many Soviet-backed) during WW2. Their ideology were denounced as radical, their tactics as terrorist, but in the end they still fought to liberate their people from a far greater evil, something the PKK and affiliate groups are still doing today.""You know, there are also people who support the PKK as a faction in the war and their right to defend themselves against the Turkish military, don\u2019t condone attacks on civilians, and blame the Turkish state as the aggressor responsible for thousands of civilian deaths, widespread destruction, and collapse of the peace process. By seeing the conflict from a single side, your arguments are no different from those used by PKK supporters.""That\u2019s an oversimplified view. Pro-democracy Syrians don\u2019t care about polling booths and whatnot. I mean, most of them probably  do, but it\u2019s far from the most important thing. They care about not being beaten, thrown into prison, and tortured to death for speaking or writing something even remotely critical of Assad. They care about not being brutalized by armed gangs, police, and military for gathering in public groups and voicing their concerns to the government. \n\nNot to mention that no one wanted death and destruction, which was brought on by Assad himself and his government. If there\u2019s anyone responsible for those airstrikes, foreign military bases, suicide bombings, and multi-year-long sieges that have in total resulted in more than 100,000 civilian deaths and widespread devastation, it\u2019s Assad himself. ""They were also \u201c[ready](https://twitter.com/trbrtc/status/916309070658899968)\u201d to fight HTS in Idlib since more than a year ago. They did absolutely nothing there since then (didn\u2019t even enter the area), took Afrin instead though.\n\nIronically, there are rumors that Saif Abu Bakr was an ISIS commander in al-Bab before leading the Hamza Division, not sure how true that was.\n""The SSG [did](https://www.eqtsad.net/news/article/18405) use the 3-star flag. Anyways it appears that only the administration branches of the SSG will use it, not actual HTS units. Most people in Idlib probably don\u2019t care about this either. I bet this Friday 3-star flags will be flown *en masse* in HTS-held towns in defiance of its policy, just as they did for the past 3 years.""I would say Latakia and Tartus are just as safe as Damascus.\n\nIt\u2019s not the same across SDF areas either. The Kurdish-majority northeast border is possibly the most liberal area in all of Syria, while the recently-captured Arab tribal areas tend to be the most conservative, including by Syrian standards.\n\nMost likely due to the fact that Azaz is a *de facto* Turkish city, with a minor TFSA presence, women seem to have more rights there than in TFSA-occupied Jarabulus (where angry, armed men, many of them fighters, forced its council to overturn a school niqab ban), al-Bab, and Afrin. Core HTS-held areas are obviously the worst.""The SDF does similar conferences for displaced people from Jarabulus, al-Bab, and of course Afrin.""It\u2019s simply not possible to legally protest against the government in Syria. You need a permit and they won\u2019t give you one for anything other than a pro-government rally. There\u2019s also a risk of being threatened, beaten and/or \u201cdisappeared \u201c while asking. If peacefully gathering is illegal, there\u2019s something severely wrong with the legal system itself, not with these protesters.\n\nThese people weren\u2019t collateral damage as you implied them to be. They were deliberately targeted, imprisoned, tortured, and killed by the government. Peaceful activists posed a far greater threat to the regime\u2019s existence than rioters did. As such they were the top priority targets to be eliminated.""&gt; If the people of Manbij, Raqqa, or Tabqa have the freedom they want, if they feel like they're treated fairly, then why are these conferences taking place?\n\n&gt; Why are they denying people's right to going back home? I think this is a serious question and nobody really has the answer.\n\nThese \u201cconferences\u201d are in no way representative of these areas\u2019 populations. A lot of people have returned to their homes in these areas, the only thing stopping these people from doing the same is themselves. They\u2019ve made it clear that they won\u2019t return until the TSFA and TAF \u201cliberate\u201d their cities and completely expell all those affiliated with the democratic self-administrations.\n\nAs I mentioned, similar conferences are held in, for instance, Manbij, where hundreds of displaced residents from Jarabulus, al-Bab, and other ES areas demanded the SDF to \u201cliberate\u201d their cities from what they call the Turkish occupation and its mercenaries, refusing to return until they do so. Not to mention that thousands of people from Afrin are doing the same across SDF-held areas. These conferences are nothing but PR stunts for their respective factions.""Of course they have the right to return home peacefully (a lot of attendees here appear to be TFSA fighters. Of course they won\u2019t be allowed to enter Manbij while armed and in uniform.) No one is stopping them from doing so. The problem is, these people  are *refusing to return* peacefully. ""&gt;  The Iraqi government is laughably incompetent... Syria has been able to rebuild in the midst of war\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth the Iraqi and the Syrian governments reconstruction efforts have been limited. A lot of the reconstruction so far have been made by locals and volunteers. Both governments prioritize repairing electricity lines and water pipes, than rebuilding roads, mosques, schools and  hospitals with focus around the capital, largest cities or in areas with strong historical government support.\n\nIn both countries there are still cities and villages almost completely in ruins and largely abandoned several years after being retaken. Sinjar is one example, Homs is another although Homs was retaken one and a half year earlier than Sinjar and held a much larger population pre-war than Sinjar.""Conscription is definitely one of the main things they are against, but it\u2019s unlikely that these conservative Arab tribes care about Assyrian schools. If anything some of them probably want Assyrians, Kurds, and other ethnic and religious minorities to be oppressed even more. Some of them are angry that the PYD and other Syrian liberals and progressives are forcing a non-patriarchal, non-Arab dominated democratic and pluralist system on what is perceived to be a deeply conservative society.""The kidnappers appeared to be deliberately dressed in insurgent attire and chanted Allahu Akbar to make it seem like they were rebels. It could be one of the government\u2019s intelligence branches or a pro-government militia, not necessarily the SAA.""[Repost](https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/9wrngn/a_conference_was_held_in_jarabulus_by_displaced).

The US and other Western countries have always recognized the PYD as an affiliate of the PKK. They just denied (rightfully so) that the two organizations are, on the atomic level, the exact same thing. ""&gt; USA promised to disarm YPG when they weren't useful anymore \n\nNo it didn\u2019t.

The PKK is waging a war of national liberation for the right of self-determination, which is guaranteed by international law. They are no more terrorist than the Turkish government they\u2019re fighting against. Yes, the PYD is an affiliate of the PKK. I agree, people should stop denying this. They are part of the same freedom movement, and there is nothing wrong with that.""A lot of their arguments boil down to the fact that many people joined ISIS and AQ because they hate, or were victimized by Assad and Iran. Therefore Assad must be removed to appease these people who would have otherwise joined ISIS or similar groups. They\u2019ve been claiming for years that ISIS couldn\u2019t possibly be defeated without the US supporting Sunni, Islamist, and Arab rebels to topple Assad. It\u2019s like blaming Jews\u2019 existence for the Holocaust. ""It\u2019s mainly for commercial trade.

The Hamza Division\u2019s precursor here did fight in Idlib under a different name back in 2015, but it was not a major faction or anything. Since the end of 2015 it mostly fought in northern Aleppo, received training and small arms (but not ATGMs or other heavy weapons) from the US to fight ISIS, and Turkey has been its primary backer since Euphrates Shield began.
