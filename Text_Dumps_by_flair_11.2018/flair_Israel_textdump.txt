""Except Obama requested it some time prior to may 2013:\n\nhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/obama-asks-pentagon-for-syria-no-fly-zone-plan\n\nAnd very much became critical of the idea later on in the conflict, a line shared by bernie sanders:\n\nhttps://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/dem-primaries/255849-sanders-sides-with-obama-in-opposing-no-fly-zone-in-syria\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/03/bernie-sanders-sides-with-obama-and-against-clinton-on-no-fly-zone-in-syria/?utm_term=.d34af253993c\n\n\n\nHowever, let's look at that inside the conflict Nusra and ISIS only started to show signs of conflict in the month surrounding this period. \n\nHad a no fly zone gone into place, then the main fueds between nusra and ISIS towards when and how to declare a caliphate would likely have not caused such a divide, allowing Nusra and ISIS to remain a formal relationship that would force other rebel groups join or disband. \n\n\n\nHad such a no fly zone gone into place, then any shred of moderate opposition would be gone, the kurds, they would have been wiped off the face of the earth as the US would have no power or intention to use them. \n\n\nThe refugee crisis would have been to an absurd degree as a consequence. \n\n\n\n\nLet us not remember that Cameron tried to argue for this no fly zone, citing a 70,000 strong army. \n\nHe became a laughing stock for his syrian \"ghost army\". \n\n\n\n\nThe only people that still parrot that insanely short sighted no fly zone line are either warhawks who don't care about syria beyond a short term moral victory, or people who genuinely ate the propaganda put out by FSA groups claiming to be so strong and downplaying the involvement of islamists. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe question therefore remains, as surely any powerful group that could rival Assad would still very likely remain. \n\n\n\nSo who would have realistically won the conflict in such a circumstance, which rebel groups do you believe would have taken power? \n\n\n\n\nAs stating \"coward republicans\" here brings up the point of sometimes being seen as a coward is the smart thing to do as opposed to storming in and making things thousands of times worse. ""&gt;Could have saved innocent lives from the barrel bombs. \n\nBased on the situation in Idlib once they stopped fighting the syrian gov, that is highly unlikely, especially given the whole . . .lack of any minorities in idllib, with the only minority community being evacuated to pro gov areas, but only after the rebels had smashed the windows of the busses and at some times almost shot into the busses. \n\n\nThen we of course have Afrin. \n\n\nAfrin, is likely the best example of what would have happened in Syria had the non al nusra linked rebels taken control (which is impossible at this stage given how jund al aqsa quite literally ate FSA for breakfast during their rebellious streak, alongside leading one of the strongest Hama offensives)\n\n\n\nYou either had Afrin, or groups that shared the same ideology of ISIS. \n\nIf you do not remember, the groups that the US backed aided others in chasing the US out of Syria once they were not only backed by a local power but also felt a degree of power. \n\n&gt;And, denying Republicans playing coward politics, DAILY, for over a decade now, is full blown ignorance. It simply can't be denied.\n\n\nSo are you saying democrats would be brave to bomb Syria blindly, at such a time when Timber sycamore was still considered a good idea and when the US was still in heavy denial about the state of the opposition? \n\n\nyou realize, part of the reason Obamas intentions failed is largely due to how David Cameron attempting to get backing saw him get completely shit upon. \n\nFrom a British lens, Obama was an American Cameron. He was not left, he was a tory. Not even close to being lib dem. \n\n\n\nHe knew fully well, if Cameron couldn't get support in the UK, then such action would be complete failure. \n\n\nIn the US, the president can expect the party to follow. \n\nIn the UK? \n\nThe role of government is much stronger. \n\n\nCameron got shit on for his no fly zone heavily by both the public, the house of commons, and the house of lords. \n\n\n\nin England, We did not play \"cowards politics\", we played general logic for the long term blowback. \n\n\n\nThat is much of why we are so critical of the US approach to Iraq and Afghanistan. \n\n\n\nMy grandparents were all involved in the second world war, they maintained this same English slogan:\n\n\"The British, we plan how to get in, what to get done, and how to get out, it's a long and messy business, but it works\"\n\n\"The Americans, however, they plan how to get in, and perhaps how to get the job done, but completely forget about what follows\". \n\n\n\n\nThe whole no fly zone screamed of that. \n\n\nquite honestly, I find it strange that you are implying that republicans are cowards for not wanting to march the US into another conflict that would last for years and end up like Afghanistan or Iraq, where the Us backed all of the parties that would end up wanting the us out or not supporting the US. \n\n\n\n\nTraditionally, republicans were the ones that were considered to be the ones that wanted war, and to march into it blindly. \n\n\nNow it appears to be democrats. \n\n\nalthough this largely reaffirms the prior piece as to how US politics is generally conservative on both sides of the spectrum compared to most modern societies. \n\n\n\n\nHowever, I digress. \n\n\n\nThe simple factor is this:\n\n1. Name any rebel group outside of nusra, ISIS, or ahrar who would have benefited from a no fly zone\n\n2. Name any of the groups that could have rivaled the aforementioned groups. \n\n3. Explain what should be done next\n\n4. Explain why you don't recognize that Obama, as a good politician, later saw why the no fly zone was a terrible idea, yet you refuse to recognize that. ""&gt; Assad, we'd be looking at a whole new, completely different dynamic now. Regardless, we'll never know now because one was never implemented.\n\nYou need to actually read up on the dynamics of the conflict. \n\n\nAt that time period, ISIS and Nusra were still allies, as infighting only occurred once the no fly zone was off the table and advances stopped. \n\n\nIt's almost universally accepted now that ISIS and Nusra would have been able to take out the Syrian government before expanding into Iraq, and would then would have become magnitudes more powerful than ISIS ever was. \n\n\nQuite bluntly, scrapping the plan for a no fly zone led to ISIS - Nusra infighting, which dramatically decreased the overall power of ISIS. \n\n\n\nYou need to actually read up on the conflict before spouting off ideology. \n\nYou are still yet to name any single rebel group that could have countered ISIS and Nusra, or would have even wanted to counter them, had a no fly zone been implemented. ""This was a CIA conduit for funding, USAID are not cartoonishly incompetent, they follow orders they are given.

""&gt;  Air support is useless if you don't have ground troops who know what they're doing.\n\nWhile this is possible, it was shown in Afrin that airstrikes can be very capable of doing the heavy lifting, even with troops of questionable ability. \n\n\nThis goes double when you consider that the US capability of precision airstrikes is fairly unmatched in terms of technology and capability. \n\n\nSo there should be questions as to how Raqqa and even Mosul went the ways they did in comparison. \n\n\nAs for Palmyra, from what I recall, that was due to ISIS having an active headstart to charge in before any proper response was received, and by that point it was unlikely to easily recover the city due to the logistics of the affair. \n\n\n""Except ISIS and Nusra both took part in the capture of Raqqa, and as the other user said: many groups in Raqqa then went on to join ISIS.\n\n\nAnother factor that people often forget is that ISIS at the time was still operating officially under the banner of al nusra, and only started to fully emerge fully as a separate entity later.  \n\n\n\n\nDismissal of ISIS being part of the capture of Raqqa is a bit akin to people claiming that the TFSA was never backed by the US because they consider the TFSA to be a different group that only appeared fully later on. ""&gt; False, the YPG chose not to fight in the cities. So no such thing could be proven in Afrin.\n\nExcept it would appear that the reason that the YPG didn't fight in cities was largely because they had lost several thousand fighters before they even had to. \n\nLet's also not ignore that the YPG kept putting out propaganda claiming excessive civilian casualties, yet that didn't carry through to the ground.  \n\n\n\n&gt;Easy answer, entrenched enemy that prepared much of the urban center for defense, for years.\n\n\nYou do realize how absurd that statement is given the years of defensive construction that the YPG claim to have put in around afrin, you must also appreciate how poorly what you say matches up with the terribly aged quotes of the YPG/J, or do you not forget this:\n\n[**YPJ: \"We will turn Afrin to a graveyard for Turkish state\"**](https://anfenglish.com/rojava/we-will-turn-afrin-to-a-graveyard-for-turkish-state-24438)\n\nEven as Salih moslem said:\n\n[Should Efr\u00een be attacked, the war will spread into Turkey](https://anfenglishmobile.com/features/moslem-should-efrin-be-attacked-the-war-will-spread-into-turkey-24157)\n\nWhich also makes it somewhat interesting how you are talking about Raqqa being so well defended when we have threads like this one:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/7rnaa2/blocked_roads_watchtowers_trenches_defensive/\n\nwhere **you** said the following things in support of the YPG defences:\n\n\n&gt;The Towers are easy targets and wouldn't be too effective. The Walls are useful as you say. Trenches and more so tunnels like showcased here historically proved to be a very potent defensive tool, especially in mountainous terrain.\n\n&gt;They are hard to locate and spot, hard to hit, pretty resistant to artillery and airstrikes if constructed well/into the side of hills. If Afrin has a lot of these then it really is going to be a difficult fight for the TSK.\n\n&gt;&gt;I doubt they have ATGM\n\n&gt;They certainly have ATGM's, number and especially number of modern one's are a big question.\n\n&gt;Example of ATGM in Afrin, here is another with a TOW. Probably another based on the sound.\n\n&gt;The YPG in Afrin had 5 years to smuggle and buy/bribe as many ATGM's as they could lay their hands of. There is certainly smuggling into Afrin.\n\n&gt;Then there are the alleged YPG convoys from the south, that quite likely contained ATGM's.\n\n&gt;Another question is how much have they mined the approach routes, when it comes to static defenses.\n\n\n\nalongside:\n\n&gt;You cannot \"target\" a trench, it is going to funnel your forces. Has Turkey deployed massive number of field bridges?\n\n&gt;YPG had 5 years to build tunnels, I doubt all of them are known. Even when the location is known these are not easy to destroy, and if the YPG has enough of these then it's quite impossible given the restriction on Turkey's air force (even without restriction, destruction of a large tunnel system can take weeks to months of an ongoing operation, and that's for the known ones).\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt;The terrain is also significantly more difficult compared to flat Al Bab, the YPG have had a lot more peaceful time to prepare and I doubt they will have to fight the SAA simultaneously like ISIS had in Al Bab. The civilian population was probably supportive in Al Bab, but is going to be downright hostile in Afrin.\n\n&gt;[On the other hand TSK would have more directions from which to press Afrin then they had the Al Bab pocket.](https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/7rnaa2/blocked_roads_watchtowers_trenches_defensive/dsyo8gl/)\n\n\nThat second bit having aged extremely poorly when we look at how al bab went in comparison to Afrin, afrin was a cake walk compared to al bab. \n\n\nAs for this: \n\n&gt;That used civilians as human shields and refused to give up an inch due to fundamentalist ideology.\n\n\nLet's also not ignore that the YPG attempted to use human shields to prevent turkey attacking Afrin:\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20180317164952/http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=87699\n\n\nNot to forget the footage of YPG made IED's killing civilians who were attempting to flee afrin. \n\n\n&gt;A lot of words, bottom line, heavy Russian bombardment failed to hold the line against a militia. Even while elite troops were stationed on the ground.\n\n\nSo, if the ISIS there were just a militia, and it's often considered that the TFSA are worse than the poor quality NDF. . . . . \n\n\nthen what does this make the YPG in Afrin? Especially since they had PKK members who seemingly would have elite experience. \n\n\nWhen we compare it based on what you are saying: \n\nISIS made gains, even against elite SAA and heavy russian airstrikes. \n\n\nthe SDF completely lost Afrin under Turkish air strikes and the rag tag TFSA. \n\n\nAnd in the first case the defenders didn't have too much time / resources focused on defence, whereas Afrin had years to prepare defenses. \n\n\n\n\nBut in short for Afrin SDf choosing to not fight in the cities, I don't believe there are many people that genuinely believed the YPG chose instead of being completely routed, after losing such a large quantity of manpower as noted here:\n\n[\"According to estimates, there are between 8,000 to 10,000 Kurdish fighters in the Afrin area.\"](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/erdogan-operation-syria-afrin-begun-180120120424928.html)\n\nwith kurdish sources claiming upto 20,000 (although in afrin this is unlikely due to the poor reputation the pro YPG officials earned themselves \n\n[\"Kurdish officials said more than 20,000 Kurdish defenders had rallied to Afrin to confront Turkish troops. \"](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/world/middleeast/syrian-kurds-isis-american-offensive.html?smid=tw-share)\n\nWhich given how it's known over 1000 sdf were killed in afrin:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SuperToucano/status/974691185284534273\n\n[1500+ deaths according to SOHR](http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=104868) \n\nand then turkey claiming at least [5000 \"neutralized\" (killed/wounded)](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/turkey/turkish-army-neutralizes-38-terrorists-over-past-week/1279891)\n\n\n\n\nWhich would imply that the YPG seemingly lost around a third to a half of its entire fighting force, by all means we could argue about ideology yet it would seem more apparent that the YPG here didn't choose to fight in afrin but just simply couldn't after being so heavily devastated by airstrikes that they were launched into a full rout. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe also then have to consider the movement of battle in Raqqa would imply a heavily airstrike dependent advance, the numbers speak for themselves when [airwars estimate the civilian casaulties in afrin to be somewhere between 1,300 to 3,200](https://airwars.org/news/raqqa-capture/) which is absurd when you consider according to US claims: [ \"The US estimates that there are between 3,000 and 4,000 Isis fighters in Raqqa\"](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/raqqa-isis-attack-battle-offensive-us-forces-over-faster-mosul-iraq-a7775911.html).\n\n\nNow compare that to SDF figures of 1,200 ISIS killed a month prior to the evacuation [ref](https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/1200-isis-fighters-neutralized-raqqa-65-city-seized-kurdish-forces/) and then  it would be apparent that such  figures would seemingly raise questions as to how exactly do so many civilian casualties from coalition bombing exist in Raqqa compared to ISIS dead if not for what could be described as bombing excessively for every small spot of resistance.

Nobody cares about dependency in the future when they're poor today, any \"business\" they lose is made up by saving millions of Iraqis money. You would have Iraqis spending more of their meager incomes due to some Western fear of the Iranian boogie man. ""Sorry if i came off a bit aggressive in the last one. \n\n\nWhat I largely meant is that unless something larger comes from it then the most we will see is that RT piece and some internal news, perhaps press tv too but it's doubtful ""I still believe the story is likely but that side is largely injected propaganda stuff. \n\n\nnormally stories like this get twisted more when there is little out there. ""&gt; People assume slopes=good armor. Its not always case like that, look at the Crusader for an example, ww2 tank. Frontal sloped armor and turret sloped armor would be penetrated easily by 20mm cannons.\n\n\nWell, slopes may assist the protection or opportunity to avoid penetration  / deflection, they definitely are not guaranteed to prevent penetration. \n\nMuch like the 40mm armour of the crusader vs a 20mm cannon the KWK 38 could penetrate 20-40 mm in the right circumstances within a couple hundred metres. \n\n\n\nThat said, however, both of you are right, it's not about increasing the protection but maximizing the amount of \"effective amour\" as in the maximum amount of armour to be mounted while fitting the smallest amount of space possible. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe main military benefit of sloped armour is that it decreased the space used in construction while also increasing the potential for a shell to be deflected or hit a larger degree of armour before penetrating. \n\n\n\nIn this case, this armoured vehicle will totally get shredded by anything larger than a small rifle, as you said earlier, even an AK could give the people inside something to be concerned about, although the ISIS videos of their armoured vehicles lead me to believe that this will likely have enough steel (or similar) to at least prevent a good amount of penetration on the passenger area. ""You're concerned about trade? Iraq was sanctioned for years by the US, I assure you they prefer reliable trading partners over all else. Raising the prices of goods will only help poor Iraqis today, the business class will find new business. ""No, they were the Invaders in Iraq.

""I may be wrong, but it looks like 4 bodies there with one duplicate? \n\n\n\nIt's interesting though that qalaat only says 1 commander but nothing else. \n\n\nI don't doubt at least 1 or 2 SAA got killed or wounded, but this takes me back to their infamous aleppo postings of:\n\n\"Attack on mallah farms, AA gun and tank destroyed\"\n\n\nas a constant stream of \"attack failed but we did something\" ""that makes absolutely no sense. \n\n\nThere is a very real argument that people make of links between the PKK and YPG where PKK fighters change badges at the border to be YPG. \n\n\n\nOne user (whom i often disagree with, i must add!) said:\n\n&gt;They are trading fighters back and forth..\n\n\nTo which you said:\n\n&gt;Evidence?\n\n\nthen I provide evidence of exactly that to which you put out some strange remark of\n\n&gt;That's not \"trading fighters back and forth\". That's \"PKK fighters have gone to YPG and back\n\n\nhow is that not trading fighters back and fourth for whatever means? \n\n\nas for :\n\n&gt;we might as well call the YPG a puppet of Germany because several Germans have gone to fight with them. \n\nno. That is germans signing up to join the YPG. That is not the German army being linked to the YPG and letting its military men join up with the YPG specifically to fight in Syria. \n\n\nfurthermore, the German army and the YPG do not have a shared ideology, nor is there any shared symbolism. \n\n&gt; It's been how many years and this is the best evidence anyone has of YPG providing material support for PKK? \n\nThat a group which is alleged to have ties with a group that is designated a terror group in numerous countries has links with aforementioned groups because they somehow border each other, share an ideology, and somehow keep finding fighters from each other working together, then yes. \n\n\nIn fact, that is exactly how the US classifies most al queda aligned groups now due to groups like this using alphabet soup tactics to keep re-branding / creating offshoots for plausible deniability, that was the entire purpose of al nusra, jaysh al fateh, tarhrir al sham , and the other names used. \n\n\n&gt;It's been how many years and this is the best evidence anyone has of YPG providing material support for PKK? \n\n\nThat the YPG has been sharing troops with the PKK, and it currently appears that the PKK is embedding itself heavily in the YPG as the main front to achieve their goals?\n\n\n&gt; If arms and money transfers are happening at a scale worth mentioning, it must be the best-kept secret in world history. Why are we using YPG as front-line infantry when we should be hiring them as expert spymasters?\n\n\n\nYou are completely ignoring what is glaringly obvious. \n\nI suppose they are spy masters to people that just don't wish to accept that links exist, you even have members of the PKK and YPG saying exactly that but you deny it exists?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am lost. \n\n\nSo are you saying, that while the ideology is the same, the figures are the same, in many cases the fighters are the same, that the two groups have absolutely no ties and happen to exist within a vacuum even though they border each other? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n""The main logic there was largely the same for calling nusra /HTS  al queda or similar. \n\n\nIt was something that in some aspects is correct but in others not so much, and if used freely would be highly prone to flame wars. \n\nSo it was two fold really\n\n1. Newer / people with less knowledge on the topic could accidentally turn it into hyperbole where they actually believe that the PKK and the YPG are the same group, not just two groups with strong links in ideology, fighters etc. (a bit like ISIS and nusra in 2012/13, they are not the same but had a fair few links, although that is not a great example either)\n\n2. It would all too easily turn into flame wars that would go completely off topic, leading to people getting banned for numerous other rule violations and it would generally turn the sub fairly toxic. \n\n\nIt's far from perfect, but let's be honest, the sub was kinda  shit show already at that stage, the YPG = PKK thing if allowed would have only added jet fuel to the fire. ""&gt; I\u2019m pretty sure HTS commited quite a few terrorist attacks and atrocities. YPG did not.\n\nWhen did HTS attack the US though? \n\n\n\nI recall this being the argument people made for HTS or nusra not being a terror group and has also been used in relation to the YPG to explain why Turkeys aggression is unwarranted. ""Because the argument that Turkey makes is that the YPG is aligned ideologically and perhaps in military or economy forms to a terror group. \n\nYou say:\n\n&gt;A relevant difference would also be that the YPG hasn\u2019t commited any terrorist attacks, where the PKK has. Their \u201creal politics\u201d aren\u2019t the same as the PKK\u2019s\n\n\nYet from the perspective of the US, al nusra hadn't committed any terror attacks when first classified as a terror group. Even today al nusra has yet to commit any terror attacks against the US, yet they and groups that operate in close alignment to them are considered terror groups by the US. \n\n\n\n\nMoving forward, the US then applied the factor of any rebrands or offshoots of al nusra would automatically be considered a terror group by the US, even if the new group had not committed terrorism as it is expected for terror groups to then exploit renaming / offshooting to avoid terror classifications and being targeted. \n\n\n\n**The point being**\n\nMany people allege that the YPG is an offshoot of very strong partner of the PKK in numerous aspects. \n\nSome even allege that the YPG name is directly done as to gain support from the US while also avoid Turkey aggression by adding plausible deniability about any links to terror attacks or the PKK. \n\n\nAs we have seen with al nusra and ISIS, numerous nations have now moved to the position where you are ideologically aligned and there is a degree of troop sharing or collaboration with a terror group, especially in close contact, then you will be considered as part of that terror group. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe argument is \"YPG doesn't commit terror attacks\" \n\nthe counter is \"Yet there is a strong connection between them and a nearby group that is largely identical which does commit terror attacks\"\n\n\nIn this case: You have a group praising a US, Turkish, and EU designated terror group, who seemingly share a large degree of ideology and collaboration. \n\n\nWhether or not they have directly attacked turkey or conducted what you call \"terrorism\" is irrelevant due to this and various other similarities, especially from Turkeys perspective.\n\n\n""Again, Nusra was classified a terror group quite early on before it had really committed much of what people call \"terror attacks\". \n\n\nAs for the YPG, killing civilians for \"collaborating\", the IED's they left for civilians leaving Afrin, and even for using suicide soldiers could be considered terror attacks. \n\n\n\nand again, the point of the matter, and i'll highlight this for you:\n\n\n**Groups like HTS are considered a terror group because they may not be Al nusra but they follow the same ideology, collaborate with members of the group known as al nusra, and for all intents and purposes could be considered to be after the same end goal** \n\n\n\n**For countries like turkey, the same opinion stands true for the YPG, especially when the YPG is celebrating the terror group that Turkey already links them to** \n\nIt's not exactly complicated. \n\n\n99% of the things you are saying are exactly the things that people hold up for why they say \"YPG == PKK\" Because they consider the YPG to be a rebranded PKK that holds plausible deniability for PKK connections. \n\n\nIt's general deflection that goes around in circles of \"this group is closely aligned and potentially affiliated to a terror group\", which is met with \"but do they commit terror attacks?\" \n\nIf you are ideologically similar to a terror group, collaborate with said terror group, and praise said terror group then it's not hard to think of why people may consider you in part a terror group that is playing the PR alphabet soup game. . \n\n\nEspecially from the perspective of countries like Turkey. \n\n\n**In short**\n\nthe YPG only harms its own image and further pushes the narrative that \"YPG = PKK\" by refusing the constant demands of any sane backer that they have to completely break ties with the PKK and denounce the PKK. \n\n\n**How do you expect the US to keep telling Turkey that the group it's backing is no way affiliated to the very similar Terror group in Turkey when the group the US is backing is openly celebrating said terror group** \n\nAt this stage it has to be said: The YPG refusing to break ties with the PKK and to fully denounce the PKK is in terms of survivability as much a \"SCW meme\" as rebel infighting. It only harms them. \n\nIt exceptionally frustrating as it seems like the YPG are intentionally doing it over and over again as if they are some form of untouchable or genuinely believe that the US will forever protect them from Turkey no matter what they do. It's like watching the group come to save somebody from falling off of a cliff only to start slowly pushing itself over the edge of a cliff. ""Aren't you brave! ""&gt; In the same vein the AKP party has the same ideology as TFSA jihadis and clearly is connected to them. What would that define Turkey as, if we follow your logic?\n\nTFSA is not a terror group anywhere so there wouldn't be any real importance there, just whataboutism. \n\n\n\nPKK, however, is a recognized terror group in numerous countries, including the main backer of the YPG, which is why celebrating a designated terror group of your main backer is not a good idea. \n\n&gt;Killing collaborators is what happens in guerrilla warfare. If you give away information that endangers many others, you\u2019re a valid military target. They would just arrest them, if they could, but well, Turkey replaced them with extremist jihadi groups.\n\n\nNo, killing civilian members of local councils, not even giving away information, but for just working on assisting normalcy. \n\n\nThese executions of civilians even led to some of the more die hard YPG supporters here having a foul taste in their mouth at it. \n\n\n\nThe last time I checked, killing civilians because they are trying to get on with life because you don't like what military force is in play there is still killing civilians. \n\n\nI'm sure if Turkey sent people to assassinate civilian councils in Rojava or members of the PYD then you'd be up in arms. \n\n&gt;Source?\n\n\nWell first we have footage of the Civilians dissembling barricades the YPG put up to prevent them escaping Afrin:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/84tymi/uav_captures_footage_of_civilians_of_afrin/\n\nmore here:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/trthabercanli/status/973936933633167360\n\n\nand of course the Video of the IED left by the YPG to hit escaping civilians:\n\nhttps://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/drone-films-terrorists-planting-bombs-to-kill-civilians-in-afrin/1083653\n\n\n\nAt this stage, you'd have to be either extremely in denial, perhaps from extreme bias, to think that the YPG are still shining angles who could do no wrong. \n\n\n\nAs mentioned before: Actions such as killing civilians for \"collaborating\" had put a very sour taste in the mouths of many as it's the same tactics the PKK used against local council members and school teachers in Turkey. \n\nCombine that with the PKK presence in Afrin and you very much have reason for Turkey to think that the YPG and PKK are connected. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n**To put it bluntly** \n\nI understand this is hyperbole, but I honestly feel that even if the YPG gunned down a town of civilians, you would still find a way of defending it. \n\n\nCase in point: \n\n&gt;Killing collaborators is what happens in guerrilla warfare. If you give away information that endangers many others, you\u2019re a valid military target. They would just arrest them, if they could, but well, Turkey replaced them with extremist jihadi groups.\n\n\nI could easily see this being applied again as justification there. \n\n\n\n**now, I'm not saying the YPG is evil** \n\nHowever, only the most extreme YPG supporters still overlook the very problematic and very real relationship between the YPG and PKK, and for most YPG supporters it is extremely obvious that the YPG refusing to denounce and break ties with the PKK is a terrible plan of action. \n\n\n\nTo many, the fall of Rojava is increasingly looking less like the work of ISIS, or the wanton aggression of Turkey, but instead the arrogance of the YPG.
