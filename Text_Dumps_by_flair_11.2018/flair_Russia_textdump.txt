Assad is actually fighting the genocidal Jihadists and other than being attacked by them Assad doesn't really care about Isreal. His motivation is to keep the country alive. Assad took Hezbollah's help because they were helping in fighting the rebels and ISIS. I'm not the biggest fan of Hezbollah or Iran but come the fuck on. \n\n&gt;Israel never supported nusra, but I guess Syrian/Iranian propaganda was quite effective.\n\nI'm not 100% sure that Isreal did, but even if they did not(which I don't believe) they sure as hell armed and sponsored at least a dozen other rebel groups. Rebel fighters which often defect to other groups and terror orgs. Why do you think Al Nusra and ISIS got so strong? Israeli arms and money landed in the hands of Al Nusra and ISIS. The US. made the same mistake and even publicly stated it to some degree.\n\n&gt;Israel did treat some nusra fighters because they did not care to put in the effort to screen the rebels they were treating effectively enough.\n\nThat's a mighty stupid excuse.""&gt;False, Assad took Hezbollah's aid first and foremost against Syrian rebels\n\nYes, like I said. Against Rebels and later ISIS.\n\n&gt;Israel cannot tolerate Syrian efforts to arm Jihadists for attacks against Israel\n\nIsreal's arming rebels who's goals are the destruction of the current Syrian government. Should Syria now Strike Isreal because of that? Start Air-Raiding Isreali facilities 10 times a month? Imagine what Isreal would do if they had anti-Isreal rebels holding major territory being openly funded by Assad. Why's Isreal getting special treatment?\n\n&gt;So much more Syrian arms and money landed in the hands of Nusra and ISIS. \n\nMate, that comes with losing major territory and military facilities. Like the Rebels in Donbass arming themselves with Ukrainian weapons, doesn't mean Ukraine actively supports them. \n\n\"A rebel group captured a T-90\" - \"They are funded by Russia!\" , wouldn't make quite sense.\n\n&gt;But that's incomparable with Assad's direct support to terrorist organizations that carry out suicide bombings against civilians and are really not much different from ISIS.\n\nWhile, like I already said, I'm not a supporter of Hezbollah but as far as I know the group itself changed over the 40 years it was active. [No wonder that the same group that once kidnapped Russian Diplomats are now allied with Russia](http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-07/news/mn-13892_1_soviets). I don't particularly agree with their motives to this day and hope that they will leave Syria once the war has ended, even though that's unlikely.

""&gt;Why the straw man?\n\nDidn't think I was straw-manning. Reading your other comments made me come to that conclusion. Excuse me if I'm wrong.\n\n&gt;Exactly my point.\n\nIf that's exactly your point why even compare the two? They are incomparable. One is deliberate support the other is not.\n\n&gt;while idolizing child killers that smash babies head on rocks is very typical of Hezbollah hypocrisy. \n\n40 years ago, see my point above. \n\n&gt;carrying out suicide bombings against civilians.\n\nOnly suspected, not enough solid evidence for or against.\n\n&gt;I was always against any Israeli involvement and aid to the rebels during the civil war for example.\n\nGood to hear.\n\n&gt;However Israel is fully justified in carrying out anti-terrorism activities in Syria against Hezbollah.\n\nMost of the Air-Raids are against targets \"Suspected\" to be in Hezbollah's hands.

I'm not ruling out that it could've been them or even saying it's unlikely but after all the circus Western countries like to perpetuate in these situations I'm inclined to be skeptical. Innocent until proven guilty, right?\n\n&gt;What makes you think the raids are against \"suspected\" targets, and not confirmed ones?\n\nStraight from Jerusalem Post\n\n&gt;Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman signaled on Monday that Israel could strike **suspected** Iranian military assets in the region, like it has done in Syria. (implying suspected assets in Syria if you can't follow along)\n\nReport by CBC\n\n&gt;Israel has acknowledged carrying out over 100 airstrikes in neighbouring Syria since the civil war began in 2011, most believed to be aimed at **suspected** Iranian weapons shipments bound for the Hezbollah militant group.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, by the same criteria, shouldn't we say that Assad's and Russian strikes are against targets only \"suspected\" to be rebel? \n\nWhy do you think there are so many SSO Recons directing Missle strikes and artillery? Isreal can't do that for obvious reasons, meaning it cannot be confirmed for sure. You get my point?\n\n&gt;Lastly, Israel has leveled far fewer than 70 buildings per year. Closer to 5-10 in the last year and fewer before (depends on what you'd consider to be a building).\n\nYea that wasn't meant to be taken literally, what I actually tried to say with that is striking targets in general. Which afaik they used to strike about 5-6 times a month or something around that. \n\nDoesn't matter either way if it's a building or a column of vehicles, people still die. And the argument alone that Isreal *\"only\"* leveled 70 buildings is laughable. What an achievement.\n""Shifting the focus of blame all the time just leads to a continuous loop of blaming the other that leads nowhere, might as well confront the accusations instead of doing that.""Not really. There were reports of additional strikes in Syria after the Syrian downing of the Russian Il-20M plane.\n\nOn average, Israel's rate of airstrikes in Syria stands on several per week, but far from all are being widely reported.""No, it wouldn't. However, it's not really relevant. What matters is where the missile is intercepted.\n\nIf the missile is intercepted above Syrian airspace, then all is legal. Worst case there will be 'behind the scenes' frowning on each other between both parties.\n\nIf the missile is intercepted above Israeli airspace, then that's a breach of sovereignty and potentially an act of war.""I don\u2019t see why, they supply the majority of the gas that keeps Europe warm in the winter which would, IMO, be the ultimate trump card to use against the EU. And with border states like Serbia, Bulgaria, etc. taking a harder line the refugees will be turned around.""But would the EU trade the moral high ground for bitter cold? But yes, the last thing Europe needs is more refugees, where unless they are turned at the border will see right wing parties that are more pro Russia sweep elections.\n\n\nAnd maybe?

Syria offered significant social benefits while at the same time having an explosive population growth. They started to lack money to actually provide the promised benefits, which led to increasing corruption (people having to pay officials to get what is theirs). In this position, governments usually either cut social spending, or put a demographic policy discouraging growth. Instead, the government *encouraged* growth by handing monetary rewards to families with 3+ kids (could be wrong here, writing from memory). This led to a further increase in rural population (most conservative/religious, poor and hardest to provide social benefits to). The drought+Arab spring+foreign encouragement then were the sparks that had the powder keg explode.""Yeah, that's the thread I was looking for.
