"Brother you find a meat (except human) and I probably eat it.""Holy crap! Trees, a new kitchen, a fridge, and table clothes! Back in my \\*continues to grumble in old revolutionary\\*. Crazy to see how much the academy has changed, even if it's only some cosmetic things.\n\nSad to see so many of my friends up on the walls. Sehid Namirin.""Why should SDF or YPG combat IS at the behest of the US if the US won't yank on Turkey's chain? Why should they work to achieve their goals at the cost of their personnels' lives when Turkey poses a far more existential threat than Daesh? ""I concur. Have seen what the .338 Lapua does to buildings and to the human body. This wasn't that.""The US has made it quite clear that it's long-term commitments have far less to do with Daesh, and everything to do with US strategic interests in the area. I don't think your assessment is at all correct.  ""&gt;...are not obedient allies to the US then supporting... for those strategic interests is pretty useless.\n\nSee how it also works for Turkey?""Man I wonder who's upvoting you and where they come from.""And yet the point remains; Turkey isn't in any metric, an equal to the US. It has and always has been an unequal partnership between the US and Turkey - who's sole playing card was their chance-luck at having a strategic geographic location (that has essentially been nullified by changing world politics and technology). Acting as if Turkey going against US interests is any less-noticed than the YPG refusing to continue operations until attacks on it are ceased is frankly fucking retarded. ""&gt; Also, Turkey doesn't need US or anyone else's support to be able to fight ypg, they just need the US to not heavily support the ypg.\n\nYou understand that this is circular logic, right?\n\n&gt;Turkey is a powerful important established country with a strategic location\n\nNo, and no. \n\nTurkey is an unstable ally whose economy is uncertain, and whose political whims are also being questioned by every single one of it's major allies. Turkey's strategic location has essentially been nullified by technology and geopolitics. This is akin pretending that Germany is strategically important (or rather, irreplaceable important) all-the-while the US is continuing to snuggle up to Poland. ""But that's the thing, the US pushes and the US shoves but there's no one currently on Earth (save China, economically in as few years perhaps) that can push nor shove the US. So if anything, this is blustering. You don't go out of your well to establish long-term facilities and bases in a country to just say fuck it because the retarded neighbor to the North whose economy is collapsing decides they need to stoke nationalist fervor before an election to distract their lemming citizens of the fact that their government is A.) Authoritarian and B.) Utterly incompetent. \n\nEventually Turkey's going to quietly back the fuck off, because the US very likely isn't going to back down because it has strategic interests in the area that are greater than whatever whim Erdogan has today. The US will publicly try to either appease Turkey, or at very least play peacekeeper between the two. Turkey will pump it's chest and then do-nothing because it knows that the US very likely isn't going to suddenly withdraw or cut relations with YPG or SDF and that any further action only escalates and any attack or near actual US military personnel would probably fuck them royally. \n\n&gt;I know you have a special place in your heart for them, but thats the harsh reality. They are just pawns in the US' twisted imperial games. Dont overestimate how much they actually mean to the US.\n\nMuh imperialism\n""I mean, the entire story was pretty clickbaity and bullshit from the get go...""Very likely a speak and spell. ""They were paid by the Iraqi government in 2016, while HPG was there. The living stipends we received, were paid by the Iraqi gov. to us in US dollars. ""Ah yes, driving through empty desert. Clearly a sign of vast Arab support for the Caliphate.""They're upset that the ethnic minority they used to dominate politically is now dominating them politically.""Making them liberate women and allow people to teach their own languages. Oppresive stuff I tell ya.""Well that was a remarkably easy river crossing.\n\nInteresting that we're getting a video of this before we're getting on of their successful offensive against the SDF.""Welcome to the world of middle east propaganda videos my friend.""Yeah but that wasn't the one that happened last week which sent the SDF back to territory they controlled 4 months before."" Rough translation for those wondering.\n\nGirl 1: \\*After some small talk\\* We're in Deir Ez. On the operation to take Hajin. All of Daesh are here.\n\nGirl 2 \\*accent is a bit hard to understand for me plus all the shooting\\* We came to this hill and fortified it. The fighters of the YPG/YPJ are making the fight.\n\nVideo ends with \"Shoot in front of the trees!\"""I only have one account. You can't separate. the shit posting and the logical, my friend.""Yeah just a standard OG-7 drag round for the RPG. ""Most their assassinations are just local police and milita members. Theyve killed more local arabs than they have Kurds at this point.\n\nAnd yeah, I always er on the side of \"not real\" with those midnight IED explosions unless we actually see impacts. And that goes for all factions.""Do I doubt it? Yes.\nDo I want it? Yes.\n\nMutual breakups are always for the better.""I mean....pretty much. \n\nHave you heard the saying \"The best kind of right is technically right\"? This is that. Technically, the US is right. Morally? Take one as they may I suppose. It's just a way to legally subvert international law to keep-on keepin'-on. \n\n""As far as I know, it is? So technically the US is using these as concealment. At least that's how I understand this discussion everytime it's had; but I also haven't gone to the source and tried to read whatever internationally law or treaty that supposed bans WP so...""Oh I agree.\n\nThen again trying to pretend the US is some humanitarian super power is a bit silly. Does the US send a fuck ton of aid overseas? Sure. Do we at least try to not mass-slaughter civilians? Yes. But also we have destabilized a fuck ton of countries and wars we\u2018ve fought in have killed millions since the 60s. Assad, in the same token, dictator who probably uses chemical weapons? Sure. Also a stabilizing influence in Syria? Yeah.\n Edit: autocorrect got me\n""I blame my phone.""It's literally one of my favorite parts about combat. People come up with dope one liners when under stress.""Thanks for posting this, I'm actually going to take a second and read this. I've seen this discussion pop up every now and again, several times and I've pretty much seen it go down exactly how this thread has with no real authoritative conclusion. \n\nBut pretty much what you're summarizing is how I've come to understand it. Concealment = okay. Use near civilians = not okay is the easiest tl;dr. ""They got a lot of their cells wiped out earlier in the year. This is the 2nd(?) Attack since they've started up again.""Probably none since HXP means local conscription forces. ""Your comment kind of affirms the parent comment\u2018s point man. \n\nYou aren\u2019t wrong, but he is right that at any angle, the US would be criticized.""Damn. Poor guy. And such a remarkable rarity in that area. Poor guy.""For what's it worth I never had any issues or animosity expressed towards me by Syrian civilians for being am American (asode from the pro-Daesh ones, but they hated everyone). In fact i had several good conversations with them about it, and they're more than able to seperate the person from their government.""&gt; whereas the Turkish Military and the Police aren't exactly known for purposefully doing the same.\n\nIf you pick up any book on the modern history of the Kurds, literally any book. You would after reading 10-20 pages find out how extremely wrong you are. \n""They, along with the other communist Turkish units, are allied with the YPG.""You ever been there?""Bingo.\n\n""Because of jets man; let's be clear on that and no obfuscate. They died because of Turkish air superiority, not because they died fighting on the line. Whether this is a condemnation of Turkey using the most cowardly tactics attacking convoys evacuating people, or a condemnation of YPG (or the commies somehow) for not letting the foreign fighters onto the line is up to one's personal bias I guess. \n\nComment was suddenly brigaded last night but that\u2018s *not* suspect or desperate at all.""You should try reading my comment again. ""Except for the fact that I specifically know that YPG was a major impediment in allowing them to actually defend Afr\u00een and this was a point of contention? \n\nAs I said, reread my comment. I\u2018m not faulting the communists, clearly the will was there, but factually the airstrikes were the biggest killer in Afr\u00een. You\u2018re omitting the point that they died largely because of Turkey\u2018s almost wholly unrestricted air campaign. But let\u2018s not omit that reality so it can seem like they died stacking Turks.""Agreed on all regards. \n\nI\u2019d anything this FSA dude\u2018s  comment is almost a mockery of one\u2018s finer sensibilities. ""You don\u2019t murder prisoners, even if they deserve it. Whoever did this, be it DEMC or another SDF attachment (if it was indeed), should face some consequences. ""There's still rebels inside Aleppo?""&gt;yeah you can't be more detached from reality from that. Kurdish areas just across the border in Urfa and Mardin are among the most conservative in Turkey. I have many friends over there, i don't think it's much different just at the other side.\n\nAnd yet I can confirm that, first-hand. \n\n&gt;Enough of this sub for me\n\nBye. ""How is he supposed to prove something that simply doesn't happen?""Yeah cause Assad never bombarded entire city blocks before or anything...\n\nBut at least Assad is able to rebuild territory. The US just bombs and leaves the locals to deal with it. It's taken 4 years just to make a small city like Koban\u00ee look livable again. To me thats the main issue is that the US bombs and then doesn't care about rebuilding.""He killed the teenager with his blade, and no he wasn't a threat, he was being treated.""That's like saying Turkey is a branch of NATO""&gt;Its called a 'safety kill' and its perfectly legal. \n\nNo? \n\nNever mind from the Medic's perspective, that there is absolutely no such thing, and it's a complete contradiction for every single thing a medic is to stand for. We don't just choose who lives and who dies. There's no such thing as a \"safety kill\" pertaining to this.\n\nYeah man; War isn't a game. But it also has rules. But you're also from a country that indiscriminately bombs civilians and locks away journalists so I guess this pseudo-masculine bs I'm reading shouldn't come as a shocker. ""It's particularly interesting in that, unless shit has really changed in two years, these guys aren't really even fighting Daesh. \n\nThey'll be on the front, but not doing anything remotely as dangerous (or 'fun') as what actually SDF units would be doing. They're coordinating airstrikes, training Asayis / H.A.T. / Y.A.T., and running CCPs. At least, that's what the dudes we were with were doing. The Rangers were going further ahead, but the SEALs / ODA dudes were stuck somewhat behind the line in Manbij and Shadaddi.\n\nMy point here being, he really hasn't any excuse to be this...psychotically aggressive. Daesh are pieces of shit, but this guy hasn't lost anything from ISIS but six-nine months of his life on deployment, at least in comparison to the SDF fighters they're there to support. ""I'm also from a country where our military spending is a pretty big topic of contention, let alone our interventionist policy that. The US is going to get criticized whether it intervenes or not, and whether it treads lightly or were to completely level a city or not. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that the US doesn't indiscriminately bomb targets by-doctrine since Vietnam, and only under Trump has the practice increased. If anything, it's quite odd on one hand you're lecturing about the US treating warfare like a game, when there's ample evidence to back-up the narrative of the \"glove's off' idea since Trump was elected. \n\nI shouldn't have made my comment a personal condemnation, that was unfair. So I concede the point you've made, however I disagree in the idea the US is a monolithic entity that can be easily discussed at least. ""Roger that, edited.""The Iraqi and Syrian branch also seem far less competent than their Lebanese counterparts.""&gt; they were fighting against the PKK in home during the first years of the civil war \n\nIt's in my understanding that the Turkish army is designed to be able to deal internally with the PKK and externally when needed as well. No? ""Don't have strong enough internet to watch this. Any indication that it's actually a YPG member  as opposed to local security forces?""I highly doubt there's any such nonsense as legal paperwork involved in this relationship, and this random twitter source is about as reliable as my chai leaves.""It's a pretty common tower design the YPG homemade vehicle makers cook up. You can see it on quite a few of their armored vehicles. \nLooks like the YPG shop cooked it up for them before giving it to what I presume are DMC troops.""I mean, if by PKK you mean Arab conscripts in the DMC sure. Although there is incompetency in not shoring up the pocket much more thoroughly.""While most of that is true, poor equipment certainly doesn't seem to be the case if all this loot by Daesh is any indication. ""Possible, but the complete lack of any YPJ in the ranks makes it less likely. An Arab YPG unit at most.""I believe they stopped the mandatory service earlier this year after protests in Manbij.""Would be YAT going there, HAT is the Asay\u00ee\u015f special forces and operates behind the lines, whereas the YAT is the YPG \"special forces\" that you see refered to as.\n\nAs for what happened to them, wouldn't be surprised if it was propaganda and they never moved there. If they were there looks like they weren't of much use in this particular attack.""Or these guys are just actually not YPG \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/9zxijt/dez_amaq_released_the_video_with_captured_sdf/""Oh man, that really sucks for the Khabour Guards guy. I hope their unit wasn't too badly hit overall.\n\nAre these just raids or is Daesh managing to hold the ground in this attack?""Does the MMC have units around Hajin? \n\nI never had a problem with conscripting people into the local village guard unit, but any time conscripts were brought to the front they were absolutely worthless. As should be expected, they don't want to be at the front. It's mostly moral, but their overall training is pretty scrappy too, but that's kinda applicable to all forces in the middle east.""Seems like their first video in awhile. Were some of them captured recently or have they just been laying low? Or have i just missed their stuff on here?""No lol, I meant the idea of conscription in a war zone. Not that I had no problem participating in the act.\n\nBut yeah, they need to stop sending conscripts to the front down there. It's not getting them any benefits.""I meant about Wrath of Olives operations.""Twitter rumors rarely have a reflected effect on the ground sadly.""Even experienced YPG units will get routed. Maybe they hit the flanks held by DMC and other SDF groups with all of these raid photos and videos we've been seeing and then just collapsed on the town in the center?""Any idea where the MFS units are on front? They just released a statement saying their units are still holding their positions after the fighting today.""\"Hmmmmm...the locals don't support us...lets bus in foreigners who happen to speak the same language\" - Coalition staff meeting probably.""Literally blamed the YPG incompetency in not shoring up the defenses in the area and I've been consistently vocal against the use of conscripts on the front line for about as long as I've been here, and I've never shyed away from calling out the YPG's lack luster military performance on occasions. \nSorry that pointing out that the title is misleading and these are literally not YPG troops in the video triggered you so hard.""The guy in the video had much longer hair though, and definetly took that last shot through the eye.""One of Daesh's improvised APC's from the looks of it.""Yeah they never really say anything about ethnicity. Most are probably Arab with one or two Kurds. Was probably an Arab YPG tabur. May they ride shiny and chrome eternal on the highways of Valhalla."
