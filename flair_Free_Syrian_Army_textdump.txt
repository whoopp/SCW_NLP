You also do not consider dwindling tribal support after it became more and more clear YPG would impose their ideology (think Tabqa).\n\n\n\nAnyways, we were talking about the weakness of DEZMC, not any of this. And the fact is, it's weak bc no one wants to remove ISIS only to be ruled by YPG.\n\n\ni have been talking a long time about tribal society turning more and more against YPG.

Iran marginally  supports Yemenis against Sudanese mercenaries and Al Qaeda .. and that somehow destabilizes Yemen? What?\n\n\n&gt; when the Houthis declared their intention to take over all of Yemen and subsequently launched an offensive to the south the next day. \n\nWrong once more. Houthis never wanted this, it was Saleh and Yemeni nationalists who wanted it all.\n\n\n&gt; A single accusation with no follow up? Great. \n\nThe accusation is by BBC who were there on the ground and saw it. This is well documented and accepted you brushing it aside just shows your ignorance on t his topic. They are still there and clashing with MB in Taizz up until very recently...\n\n\n&gt; That being said, they would never have been in this war if not for the Iranian-backed coup. \n\nThere has not been an Iranian backed coup. There has not been a coup at all.

Point is they directed their attention first on Assad, then on Hothis and now there are claims they shift it to MB.""&gt; That means that the MB in Yemen isn't a threat to Saudi Arabia while the Houthis are, therefore they'd rather focus on the Houthis when it comes to Yemen.\n\nyou are mixing up different types of threats. MB is an ideological threat to Saudi regime. Houthis are a different problem.\n\n&gt;  Saudi Arabia has had issues  .. before\n\nyeah i am talking about what they focus on, where they put their attention. maybe in 2009 it was Houthis, but after that it was clearly Assad bc Iran.\n\n&gt; You're also simplifying M.E. politics if you think this is some sort of policy shift, rather than KSA prioritising the most \"threatening\" element when it came to their regional hegemony.\n\n\nPrioritizing is exactly what I mean.\n\n\nAlthough, yes, there was a pretty significant policy shift with the new king regarding the threat-priority of Iran vs. MB.""Right. They said that the same last time but it actually ended up  being negotiations/ransoms that freed some of the hostages.""The only thing that empowers ISIS is kurdish forces in eastern Syria.""Everyone would be happy if they stayed in kurdish areas and not occupy arab ones.""This headline is misleading, since \"*NGOs*\" is **plural** but the report only notes that **one** NGO had diverted aid (and that US funding was cut off and the relationship ended when that diversion was detected).

I did not know what else to say further.\n\n\nClearly killing 20 random rebels of some small rebel group is not something Putin or Assad would order specifically, much less would Iran or Russia send in their own special forces to raid this one irrelevant position.\n\n\nThere has to be something we do not know.

Meanwhile SDF is strong but doesnt have the ability to advance and hold ground?\n\n\nI would argue the other way around: The longer it takes the   more hostile the population grows vs. the YPG. So SDF is growing weaker and ISIS gains because the capitalize on the disdain people have for SDF. This can be seen by a yearlong crawling advance and ISIS increasingly counterattacking successfully.\n\n\n&gt; Adding on injuries we can easily assume 15-17% are out of action. \n\nAnd yet ISIS gains ground vs. SDF not vice versa. I would argue these \"arabs\" the YPG claims to send in are few and sparse in number and are more a politicalshowing than a real force. They are growing weaker faster than ISIS.\n\n\nYou also assume ISIS doesnt get more new recruits than SDF.\n\n---\n\nI am not convinced by any of this. There can be no permanent defeat of ISIS without a serious Arab force in the area.
