Your false feelings about these people are just you, someone who lost, trying to spin this in another way to satisfy your anti-Iranian views. The violence came from the Sunnis themselves when they openned their gates to Daesh and their leaders called for a \"Revolution\", or what the media used to refer as \"Sunni rebels\" in 2014 : https://twitter.com/IraqiSecurity/status/592739718770663424\nThe violence, the destruction, the loses and the general feeling of them being a failure was brought on themselves, by themselves, and only for themselves. There's no one but them to blame for their current situation when their leaders decided to call for open violence and insurgency. In other words : Losers don't get to make demands to the winners. And people won't give them anymore respect or to their demands by threatening another ISIS or engaging in mass murder, the only reasonable answer to these sorts of threats are going to be bombs falling on their heads. 15 % of Saudi Arabia's population is Shia. 10 % of Egypt's population is Coptic, etc. Iraq is a majority Shi'ite country, it's only natural that it will have relations with a fellow country like Iran, who borders it, and where several of the clergy (and its population) in Iraq is dominated by Iranian population. The same way that a Catholic country has close relations with fellow Catholic countries, etc. Don't mistake Sunni chauvinism and hostility to Iran (Or what they call the \"Majus\") to what kind of foreign policy Iraq should adopt towards Iran. In Iraq, they can pray according to their rites, participate in the elections, and live freely like other peoples. What they don't get to do is to impose their anti-Iranian views as Iraq's foreign policy. If they're not happy, they can move to the dozens of Sunni countries which exist accross the MENA and outside it where they will find their ideal society. I have a question for you : How did these people work for Iraq when they banned Ashura and Shi'ite religious rituals ? How did they work for Iraq when they dispossessed more than a million Shi'ites of their property in 1979 and give them to Palestinians ? How did they work for Iraq when they started a war with Iran which they ended up losing ? etc. Like I said, they need to aknowledge their new reality and put down their chauvinism. If they want to start another \"Revolution\", they will get crushed like the other ones they did.\n\nRules 1, 3, and 8.

The kids gone, they dont know how \"turn them in\", and even if they could they probably wouldnt because they just want him back and not lose their only remaining child forever. Even accepting that you cant empathize with that and want to kill civilians simply because of their relationship with a fighter, what the fuck would that accomplish?

It may seem odd to you, but ultimately the best way to prevent violence is to wipe out the possibility of resistance even at the cost of freedoms, at least temporarily.

And \u201cpragmatically\u201d supporting a bloodthirsty dictator whose family has been pillaging Syria through nepotism, torture and murder for decades isn\u2019t being smart or reasonable, it\u2019s being a callous fool who prizes the false illusion of exterior stability at any cost, even when the structure is rotting from within.\n\nRule 1. Take two weeks off to calm down and realize that you're basically putting words in /u/samm_o's mouth.""&gt; You misunderstood. I didn\u2019t mean to communicate you\u2019re too stupid to understand my arguments, I can\u2019t measure exactly how stupid you are, but if I had to guess I\u2019m pretty sure I could place put you on a scale pretty accurately. What I meant to communicate was that you\u2019re remarkably unperceptive and lack all comprehension skills because you kept going off on tangents and talking about things I wasn\u2019t talking about. I\u2019m not going to answer back to any of your insults because it seriously isn\u2019t worth my time, you\u2019ve demonstrated your manners and etiquette in argument well enough and I\u2019m not going to come down to your level because then I\u2019ll get banned. Which is BS considering your comment hasn\u2019t been deleted yet with all the personal attacks/insults you\u2019re throwing my way. Have a good one sourpuss.\n\nRule 1. Warned. If another user is being rude, please do not lower yourself to their level.""&gt;/u/Woofers_MacBarkFloof, can you please inform us which moderator tagged this thread as unverified and on whose accord it was done\n\nThe unconfirmed tag is accurate on this post. There is no need for this.""To be honest, asking for evidence that security forces tortured a young boy - at this point in the war - and on a corner of the web with a wealth of information and discussion on this war - is not really worth replying to. The evidence is out there, has been out for years, and is overwhelming. Choose to believe it or not.""This devolved into a pretty useless mud-slinging contest. Both /u/SausageMcWonderpants is warned for rule 1 and /u/poincares_cook is warned for rule 5.""I wouldn't go that far. I think a more apt comparison would be Russia, where opposition is tolerated but has no real chance of gaining power.""&gt; You could also say they are superior to the american elections in many factors, such as voter turnout, public engagement, barriers to abuse of economic power, voting system (no gerrymandering or a system that allow a candidate with less votes winning) and even if we take your distorted comment at the face value, would be in equal footing with them in terms of plurality of ideas. No election or voting process is perfect. But given the context, as mentioned above, of civil war, instability, and external forces (Turkey) trying to sabotage your institutions and funding terrorism, they do a quite good job, comparable to western democracies (**I mean the European ones, not the joke of country you live in**)\n\nRules 1 and 3. Warned. Edit out the bold part and I'll re-approve your comment.""I don't think the SDF have given a number of enemy casualties but ISIL did loose at least one up armoured vehicle.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/VolunteerReport/status/1066368818207961090""It might just be a matter of time but I'm surprised how no western news outlets have covered this yet.""&gt; Arabs don't want democracy this is the problem, if you understood the culture you would know why it can never work for these people. The man from raqqa won't let his daughter to hang out with boys, she would be beaten if she dated. The man is the one who gives out orders in the house and he is often super religious. Personally, I would have wanted YPG to let raqqa and all these Arab villagers be and focused more on connecting to Afrin. Controlling Arab areas is something Kurds rarely want to do, it's a bad move to be ruled by a people you once oppressed. This is even why SDF won't put so much effort into rebuilding Raqqa, they have nothing to gain from it.\n\nRule 3. Due for a ban, take two weeks off this time.""Did you just compare Rojava to North Korea?""They used to be based in Afrin (near the Tel Rifat area). \n\nThey've been allied with YPG for a few years now, even though they consider themselves part of the rebellion. \n\nEdit: I just checked wikipedia and apparently it's not a single group but a coalition of groups.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_Revolutionaries""Looking back on it, you have a point. Your entire chain was very snarky, so I should have said rule 5 for you instead of rule 1. Let me quote a few particularly clear examples:\n\n&gt; I am sorry that dared invalidate your opinion (which now you refuse to stand behind). If you did not believe that the western media is going to claim this as a false flag then why did you bet on it? What a ridiculous position you hold...\n\n&gt; (not surprised that you failed to deliver on this link, but I still have hope).\n\n&gt; Nice, personal attacks always follow when one realizes that logic does not support his position.\n\n&gt; Yeah, that's for sure, but you intrigued me. See knowledge and facts are important to me, the Syrian civil war as well. However I am starting to believe you were just bullshiting me, and there was no such precedent. In that case, Indeed I was baited to remain in the conversation in hopes you held some data I've never seen, guess I'll have to leave disappointed. Still, is there a source, hell, give me an incident or a date so I can do a quick google. Unless you were pulling that out of nothing...?\n\n&gt; I guess there is no source that there was a precedent and that's your way out.\n\n&gt; As expected, nothing to back up empty claims.\n\nBeing frustrated with someone's perceived stubbornness is not an excuse to get snarky with them.""&gt; Oh the irony\n\n~~I'm assuming you're referring to the fact that the victims were Israeli. In that case, warned for Rules 3, 4, and 8.~~""&gt; And to cut down on the expenses, we should gather all the enemies together and execute them in a cost effective way. Like gas. Wonder why noone has thought about this previously..you might be on something here dude.\n\nI don't know whether to classify this as rule 5 or rule 8, but in either case, take a day off.\n\nEdit: ban extended to ~~two weeks~~ perma after rather uninventive PMs.""Recognizing the fact that the US has (directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally) played a large role in the turmoil and destruction in Iraq =/= missing Saddam Hussein.""It certainly has been in the past, few here would deny that. Today, though, that's more open for debate. I'll drop the rule 3 charge, but please keep in mind that when you word comments like this...\n\n&gt; It is easy to opt out because I showed you that Turkey is a racist state (with a very racist history)\n\n... you're leaving it open to interpretation whether you're criticizing the Turkish government or the Turkish people as a whole.""The goal is to prevent large scale invasions and it is working as intended.""My apologies then. Warning dropped. So many users here are anti-Israel to varying degrees that it didn't really surprise me someone would say something dismissive about civilian casualties who happened to be Israeli.""Hts?""&gt;Keep in mind PKK sent fighters to assist KDP Peshmerga as well in the past, so I guess Barzani is PKK as well.\n\nCould you provide more details on this?""&gt;who have done a lot of disgusting things in the past.\n\nA lot of Turks in Turkey support Turkey, who have done a lot of disgusting things in the past.""&gt;their main ideology seems to create a ethno kurd\u0131sh state. \n\nIf YPG and PKK are the same, then how is DFNS an ethno-Kurdish state?""Am I right in assuming that number has been inflated by 3-5 times?""&gt; A city from which the sovereign army retreated and ruled by a happity hippity band of teenagers with communist utopian dreams worshipping a well established terrorist leader just couple miles from the border. Turkey extended the olive branch in the past, and got bombings in its cities. It is allllwaaaays the evil turks. You stupid cunts are always righteous.\n\nRules 1 and 4. Take a week off.""&gt; Didn't the coalition just send guys there to tell them to cut all ties with PKK and not unneccessarily agitate the Turks, and then they go ahead and do this? Glad these guys are working so actively to make Syria a hot war again. Absolute idiots. If it comes that the Coalition doesn't defend Koabani they can't blame the coalition. **Kobani Kurds deserve to reap what they sow.**\n\nRules 3 and 8. Take three days off.""&gt; This is a very stupid statement\n\nRules 1 and 9. You've been warned about one-liners like this before. You're also due for a ban, so take two weeks off this time.""&gt; **You're just mad because I pointed on jihadists. Do you like them?** If the people are dead, I'm not happy about it, but video have 0 context, 0 facts, 0 proofs.. just nothing.\n\nRule 4. Warned.""Thank you.""PKK captured MIT operatives? How did that happen?""You do realise Turkey has done more messed up things than PKK? Why do you differentiate between the two?""It must be nice to blame all your problems on one side. So you're saying PKK needs to become a country, and then all their ill doings will be okay?\n\nDo you not realise your own hypocrisy?""The reason is clear: both sides want power. Both sides will do whatever it takes to achieve that.""&gt; He is not a idiot, his voters are and most just eat it up anything he says.\n\nI think the same can be said about most people around the world. (Though I'd call them ignorant and naive.)""&gt; Aipac must be physically removed\n\nRule 8. Take three days off.""I remember the events. No, they didn't almost cause a catastrophe. Government lines were holding.\n\n&gt;that this blankets can't wash.\n\nIf the catastrophe and mass slaughter didn't occur, then how do you wash it away?\n\nAlso, you do realise that 'friendly fire' occurs frequently?""&gt; What ligitimate plights. You are repeating what they told only. They have all rights all turkish citizen have already. Pressure they are complaining about is firstly came from anti-terror measures. Thing about it every day bus you are within being searched in check point with bomb searching dogs, your id being checked, and you are being checked with hard eyes. They are searching for terrorists, bombs, longarms. They are living in world with terrorist and they bring it to you every morning for 40 years like these. But at the other hand if they don't do these people are going to die. Kids will die, teachers will be kidnapped, longarms, bombs will traded easily. One aspect of problem born from itself already. The other thing is Kurds supported England at post ww1 era. In the Turkish independence war they tried assasinate to Atat\u00fcrk. When Mosul and Kirkuk (which is home of sirious of Turkomans at these days) was still subject of debate between England and Turkey they started a rebellion which is cause Turkey to lose Mosul and Kirkuk. So yes insurgency of PKK didn't came from nothing. It was tool for emperialism for a century as still as be. Todays Kurd's desires are nothing but lawlessness. They want don't close their shops in the time they suppose to close, they don't want pay taxes or they don't want pay electicity bill.\n\nRule 3. Due for a ban, take two weeks off.""&gt; You FSA fanboys cry about imprecise weapons of Assad, but with Marie Colvin you talk about a direct assassination and how precise Assad's weapons can be when targeting journalists.\n\nRule 4. Warned.""&gt; I fully agree sad that people downvote you because they don\u2018t like the reality. Erdogan is the best **the Kurds** ever had he was called traitor by all opposition except HDP for obvious reasons. He defended PKK saying they weren\u2018t terrorist. Calling \u00d6calan with \u201aSayin\u2018. Attacking anyone who questioned the peace process. PKK/YPG Kurds forgot this very fast because their current Agenda is to inject their Propaganda into the (rightful) existing negative coverage in western mainstream media of Erdogan. Everything anti Pkk was Pro Erdogan and for some it is still today. Being anti Erdogan was automatically pro kurdish somehow. I laughed and cringed very often to these comments but sometimes when I see western people try to inform themselves they don\u2018t understand the brighter context and the Propaganda behind all these TwitterKurds account etc\n\n~~Rule 3. Warned. Please make more effort to distinguish between Kurds who support PKK or YPG and Kurds in general. Of course you can make the argument that you weren't talking about Kurds in general here, but you have a history with rule 3 violations in relation to Kurds, so I'm not inclined to believe that.~~""&gt; Oh sorry, I forgot you can't disagree with the turkish army here.\n\nRule 5. Warned.""My apologies, I misinterpreted \"Erdogan is the best the Kurds ever had\". Warning dropped.""&gt; r/gangweed /r/GamersRiseUp \n\nRule 9. Warned.""Neither Svoboda or Right Sector are part of the current government. And in any case, there are fascists (including neo-Nazis) on both sides of the Ukrainian conflict.""&gt; Well he is an Islamist after all. It must suck to admit that sunni radicals are seen as nothing but tools for the US, Saudi Arabia and Israel to wreck the region for their own benefit.\n\nRule 4. Warned.""From your various comments in this thread:\n\n&gt; Haha I always knew you were a hypocritical amoral person, but never have you distilled it so purely in one comment.\n\n&gt; You know you're desperate when you have to totally ignore the concept of Hors de combat even when provided a link...\n\n&gt; But dont let that stop you from being an utter hypocrite. I'll remember this next time an attack happens on Israeli civilians and rub your words back in your face that they are legitimate targets as they are all soldiers.\n\n&gt; You seem to keep ignoring the rules of war regarding what constitutes a legitimate military target with your hypocritical comments. You can keep ignoring the links I send that explain international law in this regard, but let me show you just how truly hypocritical you are, using your own words.\n\n&gt; And you wonder why I call you a hypocrite. Just quit while you're behind. Its getting embarrassing now.\n\nRule 1. Warned.""This post has been removed because its content is not sufficiently relevant to the Syrian Civil War.

Many of the Cossack volunteers also have far right ideologies.\n\n* The [Donestk Republic organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_Republic_%28political_party%29) itself is very close to the [National Bolshevik movement in Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bolshevism#Russian_National_Bolshevism) as well as more explicitly racist and anti-Semitic groups. [Pavel Gubarev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Gubarev) and [Igor Strelkov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Strelkov_%28officer%29) are two prominent examples of rebel leaders who have many far right connections.
