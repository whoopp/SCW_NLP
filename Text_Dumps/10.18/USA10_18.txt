The Obama Administration wanted more than anything to not get involved and try to be too hands-off and so never really made any goals. The supplying of the FSA was mostly a \"sure CIA, do it if you wish\" kind of half-hearted gesture rather than a truly goals-driven part of a coherent strategy.""&gt;and russia is a part of this area afterall\n\nI wound't think so at all.

Everyone who was willing to surrender has already done so. Despite that, there are still a couple thousand Daesh troops left in the pocket. The Deir ez-Zor Military Council only has a few thousand troops, so there\u2019s no overwhelming advantage in numbers.\n\nSo you\u2019ve got a situation where the SDF has to attack heavily fortified positions with absolutely desperate and fanatical defenders, while not really having the benefit of superior numbers, equipment, or training. Coalition air support is thus necessary to fight effectively, but when a sandstorm rolls in air support is impossible, resulting in these sudden reversals.""Likewise don't let your government or officers mislead you""Where do you even find their videos? I always rely on others since I\u2019m not risking getting the NSA on me if I\u2019m not already.""I didn't know Tom could speak. Seriously though, ISIS doesn't stand a chance against the Iraqi Army. The Iraqi Army became a surprisingly better military force than it was 4 years ago. ISIS can only fight against civilians who can't defend themselves, not against professional armies. ""\"It's sunny why the fuck is it pouring rain?\" \"Welcome to Florida my guy.\"""Good post, thanks for the info dude.""Probably an effort to keep driving a wedge between the Coalition and the YPG. The Coalition will want the YPG to reinforce the DEZ Military Council, but the YPG will feel the need to reinforce the border.""&gt; villages into a big crater if they wished so. Civilians? So what? That didn't stop them from destroying Mosul and Raqqa.\n\nActually it did. I know it\u2019s hard for you to believe, but bombarding urban areas results in many civilian deaths even when you\u2019re trying to avoid civilian casualties.""There are actually a couple thousand ISIS troops in the pocket. It\u2019s not really a small force.""ISIS has a couple thousand troops in this pocket, not sure how many SDF fighters there are in the area.""From what I\u2019m reading they\u2019re also capable of light attack duties, is that correct?""Every country has fables of men fighting, knowing they're going to die; every country has its Thermopylae. Let's hope ISIS is too weak to even consider crossing the border. The Iraqi army is nothing to laugh at, which they'll probably learn, soon enough.""Correction: *They\u2019re committed to their personal interpretation* of Syria\u2019s territorial integrity.""You can\u2019t honestly believe this is an anti-US move from France and Germany. The statement was deliberately worded vaguely so each party can interpret it their own way.""Regime change and territorial integrity are seperate issues. Regime change is \u201cjust\u201d replacing a government, a violation of territorial integrity involves breaking off a physical part of the country through occupation/annexation/partition.  ""Both Turkey and France would claim that the territory controlled by the TFSA and SDF, respectively, aren\u2019t intended to be permanantly separated from the rest of Syria. Decide for yourself how truthful that is.""&gt;The rebels were certainly never recognized as an official opposition by the Syrian government.\n\nThe current regime has never recognized an opposition! ""The books don't look distributed at all. Just sitting stacked to the ceiling in a warehouse.""asserting there's a strategy to give ISIS breathing space...""Iraqi army aviation would be also rendered ineffective by sandstorms, too.""You've not been in a sandstorm before, I'd bet. Its brutal just trying to breathe, let alone fight and coordinate a fight.""Most any soldiers don't want to die at all.""Because America has secret technology to create Sandstorms when its oddly convenient to the theorists, no?""Everyone thinks there own wars were defensive. Certainly nothing to do with access to warm-water ports, no certainly never...""&gt;  It was you that said the US did nothing in the Middle East until the 80s. Its not unfair to call you out on obvious lies.\n\nLarge scale and permanent military deployments. The sinking of oil tankers and reflagging them to US flags and escorting them was the real beginning of the permanent and large scale US presence in the ME. So, its not so obvious now, is it. ""They were doing that all the time in al-Anbar when they were still AQ back in '04-'07. It fills their victimization cards when we responded.""Have you tried it before? ""But where did al-Qaeda come from? Where did Salafi-Jihadism come from? Those are the true producers of ISIS.""Salafism is pretty active in Turkey for a while now. Its just not as popular as the MB-style AKP with its technocratic and modernist ideology. But, Salafism is definitely alive and well in Turkey, sadly.""You're absolutely right, I guess I got a little hopeful last night, smh""Terrorizing the population into quietude from the fear that \\*anything\\* can happen to you if one opens their mouth benefits Assad immensely! The very best opposition is the one which says nothing and does nothing!""Exactly; there really had to have been some sort of SOP for what to do when even one person's nose starts smelling sand in the air. But, it seems as if there is not.""\"Gray Zone Project\"; seriously?""It means he doesn't like them, that's all.""&gt;In fact, I tussled with Shami Witness on Twitter repeatedly and called out his gruesome ISIS apologetics. Here I am in 2014 in an easily Google-able tweet which Ames of course left out of his paranoid screed:\n\n\\- /[https://twitter.com/michaeldweiss/status/1056613229483315200](https://twitter.com/michaeldweiss/status/1056613229483315200)\n\nHe's got a solid point there. And, this, about the author of the  piece in question:\n\n&gt;Of course, you get none of this context from Ames, who has tried and failed to do basic journalism in the US, only to have articles taken offline after they were shown to be pisspoor and conspiratorial. See here, for instance:\n\n\\- r/https://twitter.com/michaeldweiss/status/1056614129539014656\n\n&amp;#x200B;""They might mean Bradleys or other such vehicles; they could probably fly those into the airstrips in N. Syria on C-17's. \n\nThere are usually 4 Abrams in a Marine Expeditionary Unit, but those would be really difficult to get from the Gulf up through Iraq and into Syria; possible, but not probably IMHO.""Right, but I don't think C-5s can land on the airstrips in N. Syria.""Maybe labelled as \"opposition\" since anything NOT Ba'thist would be seen as offensive, but I don't recall the SSNP acting much like an opposition. ""No Tatars in Georgia when it was annexed by the Romanovs in 1801, nor much anywhere else on that part of the Black Sea coastline. Nor Tuva, nor Kirghizistan, etc... Any other victimization theories which could obviate or obscure the theory of Russian colonialism?""There's no rational reason for the Assad government to care about that anymore. There is no opposition to the Family anymore.""That't not the question. ""Then you should know better to try to take such a cheap shot.""This was done peacefully or was there fighting? ""Seems like tensions between Ahrar and the NFL vs HTS have been heating up again in recent weeks. I wonder if a new round of fighting will break out and how will the SAA, Turkey, and Russia react""The SDF needs to obliterate that pocket.""How did they get the picture to the internet? ""What caused the fighting? ""Lmao just be born speaking English then haha""Turkey definitely has its own agenda""Nah bro, it's due to hygiene and shit like that. Why do you think circumcision is a thing? No yeast infections. God taught the early Jews how to keep their dicks from falling off haha""The thought of a war taking place on my soil or in my community terrifies me. Yet, in America, it seems like everyone is itching for war or violence. They don't know the horror. Neither do I, but imagining these things happening on my streets is terrifying. Any person who kills like this fights for death, nothing else. ""I wonder if Bolton has anything to do with this. He\u2019s known to be friendly with Turkey and hates the \u201cmarxist\u201d YPG. I guess we\u2019ll see from the US reaction.""Trump wants out, but other than his distaste for Assad he doesn\u2019t seem to care how it happens. Bolton is the one who\u2019s partial to Turkey.""http://www.inherentresolve.mil/About-Us/Coalition/""Also this:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2016_Deir_ez-Zor_air_raid\n\nFew events made a stir as big as this one. People on this sub still point fingers and hate each other over it.""Lol don't apologize to me, I didn't lose any sleep over it.\n\nAlso, CJTFOIR has nothing to do with NATO. And personally I respect Denmark a lot for not only being part of the coalition, but also contributing in a way beyond token \"logistical\" support or something.\n\nYou seem eager to hate on your country for any involvement in this conflict, without really understanding what they're doing there."
