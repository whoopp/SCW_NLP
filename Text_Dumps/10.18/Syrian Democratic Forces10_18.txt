"Yeah the initial goal was regime change. Then when the rebels proved ineffective and unreliable and ISIS popped up the goal was to focus 100% on annihilating them. Now the goal is to prevent terrorists from popping up again and gaining the maximum leverage over the regime. \"Deprive the war-stricken country of its natural resources\"?? Those resources are in Syrian hands serving local Syrian people, and not making Assad and his cronies richer like it was for decades. He can go beg Iran for $1 trillion he needs to rebuild the dozens of his own cities that he turned to rubble. Indeed, no oil is traded because of the blockade on Rojava. ""Iran are part of the \"good guys\" in Iraq (kinda), but not in Syria.""So... was it Khuzestan separatists or not?""&gt;Gorran's likeliest partner would be PUK\n\nThat's not possible they won't have enoungh seats to do that. ""Russians haven't been fighting very much though the vast majority has been the SAA or aligned militias. A better (but still flawed since it's much smaller) comparison would be with Western advisors for the SDF.""I read, that, the PUK abandoned Kirkuk to the Iraqi Armed Forces in exchange for a cut of the oil revenue.""The Kurds do appear to accept democracy better than the Arabs. Just look at the difference between the KRG and the rest of Iraq.""I should have explained myself better. What I meant was that the Kurds are the most pro American group in Iraq and the KRG is more peaceful and better to live in than the rest of Iraq. Also, didn't Barzani step down?""Unlike Qatar or Turkey, Bahrain and the UAE have always been more open to dealing with the Syrian Government. As I've mentioned herre before, UAE   supported Russia's intervention and lots of Assad loyalists (including members of his direct family) have done business in the UAE or lived there. UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt under Sisi are all highly distrustful of  Political Islam; one of their main critiques of Qatar is their support of jihadists in Syria and elsewhere.  ""Not surprising. Before the war began, Saudi and the rest of the Gulf States were on good terms with Assad. They won't mind going back to that state of affairs if Iran was out of the picture ""[An official monitor of New Generation political party was kidnapped for hours and tortured by KDP security then left in a the outskirts of Arbil.](https://twitter.com/Mekut_Mallet/status/1047054979553513473?s=20)""Assad's mom and sister migrated to the UAE to live there, and Syrian govt officials have done so much business in the UAE that America has sanctioned Emirati companies over it. Emirati businessmen have also met with Syrian govt officials to discuss a major role in reconstruction. UAE also criticised Turkey for violating Syrian sovereignty, while simultaneously praising Russia's role in Syria ""The Iraqi Army also had ethnic problems.""No, no it is not. The sad fact that the Guardian, a somewhat prestigious newspaper took it seriously is a sad statement on today's media. Yes, there was a hypothetical proposal in 2009 (which would have been shut off by Saudi Arabia since it has to necessarily pass through its territory unless it went under the Gulf, and then it would go through Kuwait and Iraq and into Turkey, thereby completely bypassing Syria, thus becoming redundant.""No. The Saudis have always blocked such Qatari attempts by land. Which is why Qatar doesn't care and exports it by sea.""No, your perception is skewed. The focus was absolutely on ISIS. The US had dozens of opportunities to topple Assad or at least move in that direction with massive strength, but didn't, especially Obama refused to do so. They armed rebels, and was a massive failure, but after 2014 the focus was 100% on ISIS.  And don't give me \"muh Russia and Assad did everything\". Russia barely targeted them a large part of the time. The US alone intervened in Iraq, supplied the Iraqis and armed the SDF which were even more important than the SAA against ISIS. The US bombed the SAA like twice when they entered their proximity and ISIS was not even there. Other than that only one incident occured in 2016 that the coalition claimed was an accident and thought they were ISIS and I believe them, because that made no significant or strategic gains and it was an isolated event. As I've said, preventing terrorists from popping up is a huge part of it. The US doesn't want to go through a big lack of credibility of letting them pop up again like they did in Iraq after they left. That would severely hurt the Trump admnistration and the US international reputation. That doesn't mean that there aren't other reasons too. Also, the \"deep sectarian distrust\" you mention is ridiculously exaggerated, the SDF is among the most cohesive and stable forces despite their different backgrounds, both among themselves and among the population. Yes, there are problems sometimes, but far less than anywhere else. I'd reckon there's far more tension in the government side between local loyalist warlords and the central government or between locals and Iranians. The rebels and the islamists and jihadists are obviously extremely divided and always have been... And that's not even comparable to the truly DEEP divide that exists between more than half of Syria and the regime, which is the cause of the war. Those are the ones you should worry about. Or not. Just bomb them. ""On film probably not, but they have killed many women deliberately.""Oh that's perfectly easy! According to them, these women, who are Druze, are from an \"apostate sect\" and thus their blood is \"filthy\" and \"permitted to shed\". If you think that is not the reason, think again. They are pure fanatics. They follow salafist ideology to a whole new level. That's why they targeted the Yazidis and Shi'as in particular. If they were Christians the question is more dubious, for example they might have second thoughts about it, that's their level of sectarianism. It's organized, categorized cruelty.""Isn't the PUK an Iraqi Kurdish party?""Yes, and it's a fraud - the way they speculated about it. Syria is not even a vital necessary part to the project. Besides, it would all connect to Turkey, and to the proposed Nabucco pipeline that doesn't even exist!!""Essentially, in daesh's view (though Al Qaeda and others disagree if I'm not mistaken), they are considered apostates, even though that is an obvious contradiction because they were never muslims (by their definition of muslim) to begin with! I assume they think the apostasy was of the founder(s) of the sect and thus for some reason they are all \"contaminated\" by it. They \"explain\" it in gruesome and sad detail in the issue of Dabiq about the \"Rafidah\", which I believe is number 10 or 11.""How does that work? The MB's ideology is purely political, and even Iranian Vilayet-i-Faqih ideology was inspired by the MB's Sayyid Qutb, and Wahhabism is Puritan Hanbalism.\n\nAgain, how will that work?

Perhaps you could tell me how the project could have existed in the first place when there is no connection to Europe by Turkey. Iran's pipeline hypothesis was never seriously considered as a viable project.

As long as it stays at this sort of intensity (small skirmishes and ambushes), without 'Kurdish' fighters actually taking land back from the TFSA groups then they don't rally need to do anything, as area denial (to the DFNS) is the main objective.
