"Proper intelligence can easily go go wrong, the risk of killing SDF soldiers, let alone American or French, is not something worth gambling on, it would have been safer to warn the Coalition.\n\nAlso there was a risk of those drones being shot down if the Americans thought they were Assad's, especially after all the recent clashes with the SDF. ""Regardless of who you support in the war, more ordinance falling on ISIL's heads is always a welcome sight. ""It's good to see ISIL taking heavy casualties, though with no retreat and (hopefully) no bus deal with either the SDF or Assad, the battle is going to be a while.\n\nDoes anyone know if the Iraqi air force or artillary is still active in Syria.""Do we know if these drones used smart bombs or regular (don't know what the term for non smart bombs is) munitions?""I don't many ISIL supporters use this subreddit. ""&gt; He did request one. Congress denied it. Try to keep up will ya?\n\nYou have made several very snarky/rude comments in this thread. Rule 5. Since this is your third warning in a relatively short amount of time, take a week off.""&gt; lol. They just didnt want secularism. This is not related to democracy. They dont care democracy. Havent you understood yet? **I hope he will find democracy under the soil.**\n\nRule 8. Warned.""&gt; Ok, you win. He just peacefully protested and then out of nowhere, has been thrown into prison and tortured for no reason at all. He didn't do nothing. No way.\n\nYou have multiple instances of rule 5 in this thread. Warned.""If this were two years or even one year ago, I would probably disagree and say that the majority of FSA aren't much more sectarian  or racist than the average Syrian, but considering the constant behavior of the TFSA I can't really defend them. The elements of the TFSA that aren't sectarian or racist seem to be submissive to the troublesome groups (Sultan Murad, Hamza, Ahrar al-Sharqiya, etc.).""For background, the Atarib Martyrs Brigade has been around for a long time. Formed in March 2012; part of various larger groups throughout the years, including the Farouq Battalions, the 101st Infantry Division, Army of Mujahideen, and Hazzm Movement. It's had a bad history with Nusra/JFS/HTS.""&gt; Now time for russia to bomb them\n\nRule 8. Warned.""&gt; This is a not a good argument, the Chinese government has a bloodied history in its relations with Chinese people under communist rule, does that mean Chinese people today don't like living there or don't think it's a great place? Absolutely not. I know Syria isn't China but it can change for the better in the future as well.\n\nThe citizens of China might very well not like living there if the government hadn't [adopted reforms and toned down its repression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_with_Chinese_characteristics).""&gt; Except that the Vietnam war was purely an offensive imperialist war, one in which the US joined solely for geopolitics. Don't put Kissinger in the same position as somone who's defending his country, that's not the case at all. Kissinger started this disaster and he gets a Nobel prize for trying to end it? So I can just go out and kill countless people and the day I decide to stop I get a Nobel peace prize? **You people are insane...** Vietnam war had already been going on for decades but the real bloodbath started when Kissinger set his sight on NV.\n\nRule 1. Warned. Remove the bolded part and I'll re-approve your comment.""&gt; How can one not become irritated when someone keeps denying something so clear? How can I not become irritated by such blatant hypocrisy? I have yet to have a conversation with a republican that isn\u2019t a huge hypocritical sack of shit, that diverts to legality to avoid having to face his clear immorality and hypocrisy.\n\nRule 1. Warned.""Indeed, let Coalition airstrikes and artillery flatten every ISIL vehicle, mortar and strongpoint they can find before any SDF soldier has to advance. ""Do the SDF make use of captured ISIL equipment?""It might also be that both armies have to balance the need to be seen to be fighting ISIL and having the glory of the final conventional victory over them.\n""I thought Republican guard and 2 armoured divisions were fighting there, are these not comparatively good SAA units? ""Is their a reason why the 5th and 9th are so under equipped and staffed? ""TTPs are different during occupation versus offensive maneuvers and are being exploited. ""The SDF may as well be terrorists as far as the government is concerned.""&gt; The Syrian government must abolish all religion and must not allow Sunnis refugees returnees. A secular Syria with no Sunnis is the best future for Syria I can think of. Here in Angola Islam will keep away at arms length especially Saudi Funded Sunni Islam.\n\nRule 3. Take three days off.""Completely glossing over the fact that the rebellion started because of Assad's reaction to peaceful protesters, not due to US and Gulf backing which only came later.""Really surprised they had any tanks left. Assuming these figures are accurate then ISIL must still have a lot of fighters an equipment left in Hajin, Centcom said between 1-2000 I believe, wouldn't be surprised if it took until new years to take it. ""They must have had them hidden somewhere. Seems a waste to store them away until after they reverted to an insurgency in Iraq, maybe they were planning on converting them into giant VBIEDs. ""What makes you say that?""Is that who those are? Then the MRAP certainly did its job.""It is an odd choice to equip the MMC with since Bearcats are police vehicles, unsuited to a warzone.""He has a point. Assad has tried his very hardest throughout this war to make sure that there will be no Syria without him and his Ba'athist apparatus; even if calling the SAA \"Assad's forces\" is not entirely fair to the soldiers, it's not entirely inaccurate either.""Absolutely, must feel safer for the crews than pick ups or those lucky enough to be carried in those famous Mad Max APCs the YPG were rocking in 2014.  ""Do you think ISIL forces there are trying to affect a breakout? Or is this just a small counterattack?""Glad to see ISIL's big counter attack wasn't as successful as it seemed at first.""&gt; Stay low works with ISIS too. Want to live under them? Stop apologizing his crimes, he is not better than anyone. Infact i would bet certain rebel held areas are better, not to speak of SDF which is heaven compared to the living hell under Assad. To live like a dog under Assad is to not live at all. https://i.imgur.com/VvFnlCU.jpg\n\nRule 9. Warned. Political cartoons do not belong here.""Maybe you were born or live in the land mass partitioned and named \"Syria\" after WW1, but you are not Syrian, there is no \"Syria\", Syria is fiction. There are mutually loathing ethnicities, sects, religions, language groups, all have proven themselves brutally antagonistic since 2011. The whole \"Keyfak ya kharijee, ijii 'andna shai ya akhi\" - it's absolutely over. They have embarrassed themselves, and more. I cannot take them seriously any more.\n\nRule 4. Warned.""Right. This is as much about ensuring strict government control of the clergy as it is about combating Wahhabism.""As I said in another comment, this law is just as much about ensuring strict government control of the religious establishment as it is about combating sectarianism.""The [Syrian National Democratic Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_National_Democratic_Alliance) is basically an Arab version of the PYD that is nominally the ruling party of the \"Shahba\" region between Afrin and Kobane. Whenever Jaysh al-Thuwar and other FSA groups within the SDF make political statements they usually appear alongside the SNDA. \n Apparently they were formed in 2014, before the YPG and its allies had united the cantons, but personally I'm inclined to believe they're more like a puppet of the PYD to maintain an appearance of local rule than a completely independent party.""Political solution? The Syrian government isn't interested in that though.""Churchill once said, if Hitler had invaded Hell I would make a favourable reference of the Devil in the House of Commons. I think this applies here.\n\nIf the Saudis are offering money that will save lives and rebuild the country, then so be it. \n\nSimilarly, the French, Americans and Brits are no angels, but until fellow revolutionary nations are willing to provide 24/7 air and artillery support for 4 years to DFNS, they're the best ally The North has. ""Exactly.""Sparing the lives of rebels and pro-rebel civilians in return for complete surrender is not a political solution. And even then the government is not keeping all its promises. The Mukhabarat's habits haven't changed much.""Although the strikes certainly destroyed many fighting positions, mortars and infantry squads, only one vehicle reported hit, so it would seem that the technicals seen on recent ISIL propaganda did largely make it through airstrikes. ""Seeing those numbers, being snuffed out without warning must be quite an ever present thought for ISIL fighters in Abu Kamal.""Does this imply the possibility of Saudi troops in The North? If so I can't see them reacting well to the female SDF units.""At least it when they dropped their guns and ran the SDF could take it.\n""As had been said here before, Jabhat al-Shamiya (Levant Front) is definitely a corrupt and abuse-prone group and they definitely should not have received the support that they did from the West, but to portray them as jihadists and terrorists on the level of al-Qaeda or IS is not only misleading, it's downright false.""&gt; Where did you go to college?\n\n&gt; Where did you learn such logic?\n\nRule 1. Warned.""A bit ironic given that Hekmaytar didn't do much fighting against the PDPA.""&gt; Since you already derailed the thread, piss pff with your victimism. The european western intelligence agencies spend considerably more time spying on harmless far left wing groups than on neonazis or islamists. It's the leftists who join ypg and actually do something against islamism, **while you basement dwellers** only moan and pretend to care about it. It's the right wing govern of the west who pander to saudi arabia, who arm and support jihadist lite groups, and prosecute people who fought with ypg but let former ISIS fighters get away with it. This, of course, has little to do with why twitter doesnt censor islamists (is twitter a left wing organisation now?) but bullshit like this cant be left unchallenged.\n\nRule 1. Warned.""&gt; Ok aww sad face\n\nSpeaking of violating sub rules... Rule 9. This is your third warning, so three-day ban.""The 51st Brigade is part of the Hamza Division? Since when?""Do we have any idea if he's a local or a foreign member?""Must have been a bloody good shot with one of those large calibre sniper rifles to disable it. \n\nHow often are ISIL VBIEDs used on the Hajin Front?""The Al-Tanf Rebels aren't in a position to fight ISIL or counter Iran with so fighters.\n\nThe only logical course of action for America is to send MaT and its equipment to The North and join up with the SDF to actually fight ISIL.""Hajin has been the retreating point for ISIL from the SDF's Dier Ezzor, Raqqa and Tabqa campaigns, the Iraqi's border campaigns and likely the Regime's Dier Ezzor and T-4 campaigns. \n\nThere's also no place for ISIL to fall back or be bussed to, so this is a battle to the death for them. ""&gt; Don\u2019t you know, we should have left the glorious and invincible SAA to take out ISIS with the help of superior indiscriminate Russian air support. Never mind that they would have done nothing to help the Kurds in the north, and are part of a murderous dictatorship themselves. Also the Iraqis should have totally asked for Syrian help with ISIS.\n\nRule 5. Warned.""~~No warning, but please avoid one-word comments like this.~~""I know a tactical unit is a slightly vague term, but even if its only 3-5 fighters each, 68 of them being hit must add up to a lot of casualties. ""This is amazing. Shame the full article isn't publicly available. Mind if I cross-post this to /r/anime? I doubt it will get many views but some might appreciate it.""&gt; \"The enemy of my enemy is my friend\" is a saying for a reason. Trying thinking a little harder about it, uses some reading comprehension skills and recognize that Assad is not a \"good actor\" and has long been linked to sunni extremists. You do realize that this type of stuff has always happened in conflicts? Are you ready to deny that something like the idiotic US occupation of Iraq had nothing to do with the creation of IS either? Because its basically the same type of claim. I have to believe you are being willfully ignorant.\n\nRule 1. Warned.""It's hard to film a body for propaganda purposes with a building collapsed on top of it""&gt; Kafr Hamra is a front line town. Not only are the parents dumb to stay there, they gave birth to a kid during the war. It's like sending your kid into a burning World Trade Center, then crying victim. Stupidity on so many levels.\n\nRule 8. Taking into account your prior history, take a week off.""Do we know who broke the agreement first? AFAIK both HTS and folks and the government pretty much ignored the \"demilitarization\" from its announcement.""&gt; Pffft what a load of cliche baloney to spout. Let's be real, their faces will soon be posted on this forum, cue the usual R.I.P comments, and that's it. Just more casualties of the Syrian Civil War, nothing more nothing less.\n\nI'm not going to give you a warning because I'm not sure your intent was to trivialize their deaths, but in any case you should take a bit more care with your comments. Nothing really wrong about being bluntly realist about this terrible war, but please remember that for the sake of discussion here we have to keep our words to a certain standard.""are the sandstorms which prevented coalition airstrikes still going on?""I think Lynak's point was that your definition of an ideologue would probably describe more than half of the people on this sub. And in general, you should avoid saying things like \"this user only posts pro-[insert faction here] articles\" (the implication being, \"... he's one of those crazy guys so let's ignore his input\").""&gt; You're a cunt. We should ban you because your words annoy me.\n\nRules 1 and 5. Take three days off.""&gt; Ahahaha... Please, do not be upset! I do respect your occupation, it is job, so no needs for personal attacks. Just troll someone else - I have been read you LoL\n\nRules 1, 5, and 9. You're due for a ban, take a week off this time.""&gt; Turkey is terrorist nation, they are no better than the PKK and have no moral high ground. The PKK were right to arm themselves because Erdogan wanted to wipe them out and they needed to be ready. Do you think the Kurds would just go peacefully into the night while they're second class citizens being oppressed in their own land? Is that what you expect them to do? And now Turkey has invaded Afrin and began murdering it's civilians and raping it's land, and is sponsoring Al Qaeda in Idlib.\n\nRule 4. Warned.""&gt; So you're just going to cry 'FakE nEWs'? Oh well good luck with that.\n\nRule 1. Warned.""&gt; Sure if it helps you sleep at night. I have no time for the likes of you. You are clearly delusional. Blocked.\n\nRule 1. Warned.""Is their any indication of what ISIL casualties are like in their big offensive?""I would certainly hope that this is ISIL's Battle of the Bulge one last bloody offensive that will soon run out of steam when the skies clear and airpower comes back into play.""YAT are part of the YPG, whilst HAT are part of Ayaish. Although the difference between a police counter terrorism unit and military special forces have been is basically non existent in this conflict.  \n\nJust look at the Iraqi federal police and Mosul SWAT teams being used as conventional soldiers.""&gt; I can imagine higher than room temperature people looking at the source, all staged videos, this is someone in SAA clothes.\n\nRule 4. Warned.""Iran has attacked expatriots on occasion.""Why do the DMC have such a poor reputation compared to the rest of the SDF?""Evidently there's still more strikes that need doing, would be easier if the Australians, Canadians, Dutch and all the Arab world didn't pull out.\n\n""&gt; You're on the wrong sub dude, the circlejerk is that way ---&gt; r/israel.\n\nRule 5. Warned.""&gt; Sure. This time for real (tm).\n\nRule 9. You've been warned for this type of comment before and you're due for a lengthy ban. Take a month off this time.""&gt; PKK terrorists will be purged from Menbi\u00e7 soon.\n\nRules 5 and 7. Warned.""ISIL was able to push back the SDF but now that they're not covered by a sandstorm Iraqi and Coalition air and artillery will stop any further counter attacks.\n\nISIL have delayed their defeat at Hajin but with fewer than 2000 men they won't be able to effect a breakout operation.
