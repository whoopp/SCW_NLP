Wonder how the SDF and Coalition will respond""1 friendly fire by Syria, 1 shot down by MANPADS.""The key question is who gives orders for the batteries.""The US said, that if Iran blocked certain passages, it would be an open act of war.\nSo this guy roots for an open act of war against Russia?\n\nAnyway, this is just pointless talking. ""Haha  there is a difference between an ally (Iran) and an aggressor (Israel)""No it\u2019s not...in what world has an country prohibited an ally from using whatever conventional weapons they have at their disposal against the enemy?\n\n\n""They launched a missile after Daesh attacked Tehran a few years ago and Damascus said nothing, again they are allies in this conflict so Damascus doesn\u2019t care.""By ready do they mean Training the Syrian operators or just placing the equipment?""Yeah they are not the most precise but more than half landed within 50m of the target ""However you want to word it, probably both. ""With combat operations having been undertaken for so long, this is surprisingly low, good news for the armed forces.""Considering that dozens were killed by aircraft falling, the combat death ratio isnt that high ""Do we know how many hit the target?""Maybe Israel is attacking the S-300 shipments""Yeah, but the attack could extend to other areas""Yeah, and Damascus is the perfect place for that ""Geneva process is dead""5-6 PM?""Is Rashayh near latakia?

Also, there is probably a very complicated financing arrangement. I doubt Syrians have the cash on hand.""I'd consider (85,000+18,000)/2 = 51,500 \"terrorists\" (including FSA and any other rebel group, of course) and (0+8000)/2=4000 \"civilians\" more likely figures than these two. \n\nOf course, some \"civilians\" might be \"off duty\" fighters, while \"terrorists\" would probably include many random people (if you are working for a terrorist group as an IT specialist or doing their laundry, are you still a civilian?).\n\nIn principle, the talk of civilians/non-civilians is more applicable to wars between uniformed armies. This is more of criminals/bystanders kind of thing.""so why give them at the 1st place?""if it was just the S-300.... but the system is going to be integrated""Well, in 3 months Syrians should be ready to take over, and hopefully there will be no Russian staff at these S-300 locations.\n""So essentially making sure that no salafist leaning material is made available in the Syrian press/media? I can get behind that""I mean why give the buttons?\n""Depends.... Will the Russian crews attack them?""I dont know about this one""How is that the end of secularism?""Doesnt need to be on these networks""But wont these islamic centers be government regulated?""Russia killed 100k civilians? I doubt that""But like the other guy said the partcipants of several of these groups are already out of mandatory military service""They deployed 4 TELs so far, could be more""They said it was 49 pieces and they deploy 4 TELs, maybe they will deploy more tels or focus more on Short range defense""The link says they've killed 100,000 terrorists, 85,000 of those being an achievement of aviation. Not sure why you've posted it.""I doubt they officially stated they killed 100k terrorists""Isn't a battery like 3 launchers? 4 would be an extra one and they could be deploying more TELs""For defending Latkia or damascus 1 battery with 4 launchers would be enought, especially since it wont be only these batteries that will destroy the Israeli missiles up close""&gt; It states the source article is from TASS\n\nIt doesn't say even that. You can't just make up the contents of an article, some people read Russian.""I meant only damascus or latkia or one and the outskirts of the other.\n\n1 battery is good for protecting strategic assets on a certain area and the centralized network together with EW will help even more""How do you think this trend will cope with the ever so increasingly pace of technology? With more and more globalization what do you think will happen?""Well, first you will have fulfilled your obligations and saved face. \"Syrians have the control\". What is the reality only Russia and Syria will know. \n\nSecondly, if there is a real need to down a plane, whether Israeli or Turkish or some stray British one, you can shift the responsibility to Damascus, which is just defending its airspace. If Russia downs a plane over Syria, it is a much more complicated deal. Syria, on the other hand, already downed Turkish and Israeli planes, so for them it is just a routine matter usually. \n\nBut Russia should retain control because it risks its personnel at these locations, and also Syrians may down somebody by accident, Turks over Idlib for example. In 3 months you can withdraw advisers and be more or less sure that Syrians do not make technical mistakes.""How is that not enought? Yeah it could be more, but for defending certain Strategic assets in a region it is enought and may make the Israelis act with more caution ""Is the PMU-2?""They said in a 2 week timeframe, more could be delivered""Depends on size""Well he isn\u2019t wrong.""But then what are the rest of the 49 pieces? Also the missiles are for the PM2 which isnt export version""But then what are the rest of the 49 pieces? ""We dont know if ALL missiles are 5V55R""So that means there will be a range of different missiles""I doubt it is only the S-300""the PMU batteries... not the PMU-2""short range systems to destroy these ammunitions""yeah, they also sent 49 pieces which is a lot""Monsters, may they be hunted to the ends of the earth ""it is way better to test with a live fire battery. if you considers this way, in theory, Israel is prepared against the S-400 ""yeah and they took that togheter with EW seriously. Some people said that it was a token measure because only 4 TELs were delivered but i think the Russian plan is to not allow israeli planes to fly to high and then deny them good windows of strike without necessarily destroying the plane""also the could be similar variants like the 5V55KD""&gt; in theory, Israel is prepared against the S-400\n\nWhich is PMU-3 anyway, not something revolutionary different like S-500. \n""yeah but they will also be fighting the ground EW, i think the israelis will indeed change some of their tatics""the S-400 is very different because it isnt an export version""no, it is not even close""Well, ideally we compare export versions with export versions and domestic with domestic ones, of course. But in general terms, these systems have more in common than not. \n\n*The principal distinctions between the S-400 and its predecessor lie in further refinements to the radar and software, and the addition of four new missile types in addition to the legacy 48N6E/48N6E2 used in the S-300PMU2 Favorit.*\nhttp://www.ausairpower.net/APA-Grumble-Gargoyle.html#mozTocId84261\n\n\n\n""yeah the S-300 is for intercepting missiles, there needs to be more systems""No doubt that Israel can \"beat\" it. It has just too many assets too close by. The questions is, what will be the price. Can Israel do it with a single precision strike or will it have to launch a massive operation and saturate defenses? The price of such an attack may exceed the value of the target, and also reveal some technologies that Israel would want to conceal.\n\nIndeed, Israel has the advantage of the attacking side. It chooses when to strike and how. And it has been preparing for this since at least 2013.""wonder how that will change if the groups are not helpful with the DMZ deal""i dont think a single strike would suffice, especially since there are other systems protecting it""Even if the export version of the S-300 maned by Syrians wouldnt success, it doesnt mean that Russia will loose orders, the S-400 is much more advanced. ""cant imagine what will happen when they are forced to get out of the DMZ""so why do you sell patriots to the saudis who are invading and destroying Yemen?""yeah, but also helps that EW will be active and that several radars will integrated""it is not supposed to protect all of Syria, either latakia or damascus. Iran has 4 S-300s and the west got so whiny about it. There will be also better coordination between the systems and EW""i doubt they will put these separated, they will either protect latakia and tartus or tartus and damascus""same with Russia and Syria""most of the opposition at the time was ISIS and HTS""HTS, AQ and ISIS""@worldonalert supports even ISIS if it kills SAA soldiers""will we go on to future history books (or whatever they use) as the proffesional shills or as internet witnesses of the war ? ""he didnt say it isnt""5V55R or 5V55KD. these are for close range but the missiles on the TEL itself was for long range""The NFZ  was in 2016""They will use the S-300 against bigger missiles, not glide bombs or most AGMs""These are older missiles for shorter range, maybe with the other close range systems they didn't fell the need to supply advanced missiles for short range ""Great way to get either Turkish or Russian heavy weaponry delivered at you""Was that the only reload? \n\nHere could be some reasons:\n\nTesting: These could be the 5V55KD or some newer short range system, they could test it under real combat situations (could intercept Hostile Ammunition on its path more easily)\n\nProtection: having this short range missile on at least 1 TEL can be good for picking targets the long range ones didn't pick and make the overall defense for the System better.\n\nTactics: There are many tatics involving this system and  having these missiles can make these strategies more flexible""Since when is Wahabism a traditional way of life? ""Without the terms of the DMZ being honored i think Russia could authorize a military operation""It is authentic. As well as that raptor pic.

No, no major player gave a crap about ordinary citizens whether it be from a Western prospective or the perspective of Assad\u2019s allies, geopolitical goals came front and center; Russia and Iran intent on maintaining an ally, and the Gulf and co intent on ousting a friend of Iran and installing a friendly group in its stead, whether they governed effectively or not wasn\u2019t really a concern.\n\nAssad did listen to the populous, just the percentage of the population that didn\u2019t want a revolution.
