So Syria had been preparing for a possible Turkish invasion, thus planted a lot of olive trees to hinder such an invasion from Hatay and Kilis provinces.\n\n\nThis all until some treaty was signed back in 1999 IIRC that outlawed the PKK, from there glorious Apo fled to Kenya where with the aid of the US the MIT captured him.

Maximize enemy casualties whilst you minimize your own, and this at almost any cost, and that includes the habitat. \n\nI highly doubt the US gave a flying fuck about the habitat when bombing nam with napalm, neither did Turkish military care when they destroyed any all natural caves in South-Eastern Turkey. Neither will any other military. We are literally talking about invading, conquering land, people go out of their way to kill one another, why would they stop for nature?

These are no armies.\n\nI will let you decide whether most of SDF looks like an real army or not.

""Sure. It would have been best if ISIS took YPG, cause that way Turkey could have initiated an operation themselves to control a larger stretch of the border.\n\nBut realistically speaking with the involvement of the US, Turkey knew it would be nigh on impossible for ISIS to defeat the YPG. So Turkey settled for the next best thing, letting the two sides fight out.\n\nIt was the smartest thing to do. ""Yeah, I remember his speech. But you should also remember that local YPG leaders announced the near fall of Kobani as well at the time. However Erdogan's millitary staff surely kept him upto date on the realistic outcome of thr battle once the US stepped in. We know from plenty of historical cases that once the US steps in they usually fullfil their objectives.\n\nI didn't really think Kobani would fall when the coalition was investing so heavily into their air campaign. To the point where I believed they'd even sent in regular ground troops to prevent it. ""I don\u2019t consider these people as humans, and that\u2019s that.""SAA, ANA, US Army, Russian Army, IDF, TAF. Iranian Army, These are real armies. \n\nNone of these groups were an army earlier at some point. There is no reason for SDF to become a real army.\n\nIn fact they are in the process of becoming one.\nThey weren\u2019t before SCW. PKK is a terrorist organization.

Like most likely chopping up a guy who was barely a dissident, Khashoggi, in a foreign country, the Hariri kidnapping thing, Yemen. There is a lot of goodwill by the younger saudis to carry out serious reforms aiming at diminishing the power of the clerics and islamists, someone with MBS' authority could make positive changes without all these insane other adventures (and massacres).\n\nI guess that's what the west is starting to realize.""Currently it is pitifully weak compared to any country in the area, worn out by 7 years of war. On its own, It was unable to beat the light infantry forces of the rebels, who generally lacked any significant artillery and armoured support, and who had absolutely no airpower.\n\nOnly the assistance of foreign forces enabled the SAA to reverse the course of the war.\n\n  ""They never had large quantities of artillery or shells, the rebel propaganda videos very rarely showed the presence of one or two guns in an area. The foreign support gave them access to light arms and ATGMs only - a tiny fraction of the force of a formal military.""If these so-called \u201clarge quantities\u201d of artillery existed , why are they not part or rebel propaganda videos? You never see more than one or two guns, and even the drone footage various groups have released of their artillery barrages demonstrate a very light fire intensity consistent with just 1 or two guns firing.\n\nNone of the rebel groups has ever appeared to have a large battery of guns or launchers under their control - because these systems are rare amongst the rebels.\n\nUnlike small arms and mortars, artillery guns and launchers are far from easy to smuggle across borders. ""Which comes back to my point. The Syrian army couldn\u2019t fight independently and beat an opponent that could not field any significant volume of artillery in a single battle ""May I ask, what is the importance about who fights, be it the DeZMC or the YPG/J.

""&gt; Terrorist is a fun, convenient little word to disregard the other side. But Turkey didnt have a single one of the problems you listed there. But ofcourse, Turkey supports ISIS! I saw a grainy video with some trucks as evidence. No doubt they do.\n\nSarcasm and a colorful ban/warning record. 30 day ban""&gt; Funny FM's target 'after Idlib' isn't Afrin and al Bab, they're so close and it's the same perverts. Or maybe he means he'll give the area east of the Euphrates to Erdogan too? That's certainly what would happen.\n\nRule four. 14 day ban.""Let's go one by one, shall we?\n\n&gt;Is federalism possible? \n\nSure. The country is de facto divided right now so.. the difficulty is usually devolving central power but that has already happened. \n\nThe bigger question I'd like to float (I have an opinion but I'll choose to foster discussion) -- is it sustainable without outside intervention? \n\n\n&gt;Would Assad allow it? \n\nAt this point, Syrian sovereignty on the ground exists in the realm of choosing between options handed to him. Russia pushes for one solution, Iran for another -- Assad's options are in that hypothetical scenario limited to those two or some hybrid compromise between them. His capacity to forge a unilateral, Syrian solution to major problems is quite limited. \n\nHe can of course play different actors against each other. The United States.. not so much, because the United States' long-term interests in Syria are almost completely opposite to the regime's. \n\nBut -- Turkey? I think Assad can in the future insert Turkey as a balance to Russia and Iran in this situation. Turkey's fears of a long-term PKK stronghold in Syria mean that Syria could (under the right conditions) get a lot of help from Turkey. \n\nRussia likes to assert control of feuding parties in order to control both. An example I like to give frequently is Armenia and Azerbaijan, where Russia is the primary geopolitical ally of both. I can further flesh out that example if necessary but -- I think the point is clear. In such a case, Russia's long-term interests *can* be suited by allying with the PYD and Damascus simultaneously, supporting Kurdish autonomy as a balance to Assad regaining full sovereignty post re-construction. We have seen Russia push for autonomy already, with the federal constitution rejected by Assad thanks to what I would assume is support from Iran. \n\nIran is a little more interested in a strong central government and keeping Syria on board with \"Resistance Axis\" (against Israel) policies. Particularly, Syrian needs to regain its strength to support Hezbollah and potentially Hamas. So they're probably a no in terms of Kurdish autonomy. Although -- Iran has historically left the door open to using the PKK as a chip against Turkey to balance its conventional weakness with asymmetric responses. It's possible it could happen again but right now, Iran's perspective is that the PYD = USA. \n\nSo the question -- would Assad allow it? He certainly doesn't want it. It's more of a matter of if he has a choice.. I think it's safe to say Iran and Turkey do not want an autonomous Kurdish region. The major problems are:\n\n1) Iran's Turkey paranoia. Iran can fight off the rebels and the SDF (assuming the Americans leave) but cannot offer its ally in Damascus a solution to remove the Turkish military from its soil. The two (Turkey-Iran) need to come to some compromise.\n\n2) The United States is tying Assad's hands somewhat. The major function of Russia right now is shielding the regime from the United States. I don't believe Assad needs Russian airpower to defeat the rebels at this point. Russia isn't really worried about Kurdish autonomy and Russia is really the only power which can pressure the United States east of the Euphrates. So Assad will either need to convince Russia against Kurdish autonomy or hope the USA leaves for some other reason. \n\n3) Receiving help from Turkey vis a vis the PYD is problematic for Damascus because Turkey is the more powerful neighbor which, once it shows up on the ground, is tough to get rid of. A lot of naive discourse in Turkey these days is suggesting we help Assad with the PYD but they are missing the point that Assad views Turkish influence as a long-term problem which it has little to no leverage against. Give your hand, lose your arm. That sorta deal. \n\n\n&gt;Do Syrians support it?\n\nWho knows. Does it matter what Syrians support any more? I don't mean that in a derogatory manner or in the sense that we shouldn't care about what Syrians think. But the actors on the ground don't care, international powers don't care, and it's not being factored into decision making at any level. \n\nI think Syrians just want to stop suffering at this point. With all the talk on this subreddit about Afrin being heavily pro-YPG or the \"strongholds of the rebels\", you would think there would be difficulties occupying areas which have been captured... I really have seen nothing of the sort over the past several years.""Sure they do. They're just pragmatic enough to realize that's not exactly possible right now and ask for less. \n\nGood on them for that but -- it doesn't mean they don't want a state. \n\nSeriously go look at how many independent Kurdistan maps PYD supporters have as their profile pictures on Twitter. Their support base isn't that detached from the party, they're just not as diplomatic. ""Well the government is totally opposed to decentralizing power. ""KSA seems to forget that they are not USA or Russia. And they are not as geopolitically competent as Iran. Turkey may have way too complicated relations with such actors or just may have not enough teeth to respond accordingly against USA or Russia but I'm sure our unreasonably nationalist and infamous agencies can have a field day with entertaining possible covert actions to hurt/annoy KSA.

""As stated in the title this attack happened in the Dayla region of northern Iraq on October 22 2018.\n\nThe video really shows everything. A group of three PKK/HPG insurgents close in on a fighting emplacement occupied by one soldier. The soldier kept his guard down and met an awful surprise. \n\nHis position was bombarded by multiple hand grenades, he managed to retreat from the inital volley of grenades but was gunned down rather quickly. \n\n\nIt appeared the PKK/HPG guerillas stole one PK machinegun, one MPT-76 rifle, one mine detector and one Piton thermal sight. \n\nThe whole attack left one soldier KIA. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the greater picture, this attack is worthless. the Dalya regions borders right the Qandil region, meaning the Turkish military is almost inside the heart of the PKK. All of this with minimal casualties and minimal resistance. \n\n\nEven the weapons and equipment they stole is also not that much of a value, stealing maps would've been more useful I guess. This ambush is great propaganda however. (for both sides, since it shows the military is DEEP inside Iraqi/PKK ground).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe KIA soldier is:\nInfantry Private First Class(Piyade Uzman Onba\u015f\u0131) [Sedat KASAP](https://imgur.com/a/pv9ZsmW)(22).

I might be the only one thinking this, but i'm glad he is the only one that was killed. He let his own guard down, and paid the price for it, his actions could've led to more soldiers being killed/wounded. \n\n\nSecondly pretty scummy that the PKK/HPG insurgent went back to shoot the soldier a few more times, I mean he was already down and not a threat anymore. The soldier was already neutralised, no need to go back and blow more round into him. \n""The SDF had attacked Turkish forces as well, this before Olive Branch. Turkish forces responded with an M113A2T2-TOW and destroyed a technical or something along those lines. This also had happened more than once, all again pre-Olive Branch. \n\nEDIT: [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vvrFr9PLak) is the M113A2T2-TOW returning fire on SDF (YPG/J IIRC) forces after they had opened fire on Turkish forces. \n\nEDIT#2: That's an M113A2T1-TOW, not T2 ;) ""Dude you act really surprised, its not a secret that Turkish forces and SDF forces don't go along (since before Olive Branch), same goes for US forces and Turkish backed-Rebels. \n\n\nRemember these patrols are just US and Turkish forces, the MMC and TFSA will be kept away. I wouldn't be surprised if during these joint patrols inside Manbij might lead to some light clashes between Turkish-US forces and some rogue MMC members.

Although honor killings are not a rare occassion in Syria this level of disregard for consequences is surprising. \n\nTurkey should either rule their defacto Syrian territories with an iron fist or not be involved in Syria at all.\n\nThis half assed occupation only causes grief and reflects poorly on Turkey. Either deal harshly with these criminals and enforce order or get the fuck out of Syria and let the YPG do what they wish in there. \n\nI'm saying this as a supporter of operation ES/OB. ""Yeah yesterday , I already predicted a go-pro video, however not this quick lol""I meant as in they won't particiapte in the patrols. It will consist of just US and Turkish troops conducting the patrol. That's why it's just US and Turkish training/preparing. ""Like the other comment said, I meant US and Turkish forces clashing against militia members. I guess I phrased it a bit weird, sorry for the misunderstanding. ""That's most definitely TAF and not TFSA. I have no clue about the exact location, but a lot of stuff has happened around Nusaybin and Qamishli. \n\nThe TAF would make announcements as to what happened, sometimes even down to the amount of (heavy) munition fired as a response. \n\nIt usually just sniper fire or mortars coming from the SDF, at least that's the story the TAF told, so take it with a grain of salt if you wish. \nHowever I do know for a fact TAF members have harasst SDF forces in Qamishli, more specifically with lasers. There was this video a few years ago showing SDF members being tagged by a green laser coming from the Turks, pretty weird lol. \n\nBack to the ATGM strike, I'm fairly certain that was between Nusaybi and Qamishli, and that was most definitely  a  response to SDF aggression . \n\n""Yeah I understand what you mean, kinda stupid nit pick indeed.

I think if an attack was eminent we would have seen an airstrike rather than artillery shelling ""It's not the same I agree, but somehow people were with all the confidence in the world continuously saying the exact same thing about Afrin, and we saw how that ended.""It deciding things in Syria was never the topic of conversation. People comment on each other's perception on issues about this war on basically every post. ""You are creating an alternative reality but whatever rocks your boat mate.""Why does the regime even think this is in their interest to do? I mean surely they can keep control on the country without this type of evil for the sake of it actions? Leaders like Sisi and such are perfectly capable of keeping control in an authoritarian way without going this far. ""You are just trolling at this point.""That's the thing with mountains, if they have caves/if Daesh has time. They can and probably will dig in deep. After that cleaning mountains is a dangerous and bloody task. That would mean the US needs to use more expensive Bunker Buster's and mountain warfare for the SDF. ""I wonder what tanks will be provided to them? Monkey model M1A1s? (Or just the ones without DU I guess). \n\nStill a deadly machine in the hands of a well trained crew. ""Oh well that actually makes much more sense , do you happen to know what tanks the YPG operates. Some T-62s and T-55 were captured by Turkish forces in Afrin, but I suppose/hope the YPG has some T-72s. \n\n\nBMPs won't do shit, those driving lighters are nothing but a thread for the operators. \n\nYour better of using a pickup truck. \n\n\nEDIT: do **you** happen to know....*\n\nDon't Reddit after a 10 hour long work shift lol . \n\n""The C-17 Globemaster, if that can't do the job. The C-5 Galaxy sure as hell is capable of transporting an Abrams. (I believe even two at once) . \n\n\n\n""Yeah, I didn't mean to imply Turkey was about to invade, just that people have already been proven entirely wrong after continuously claiming it's just empty rhetoric from Turkey.""So it's propaganda that government soldiers or allied militias have at all abused and raped civilians? Or is this a 'yeah but they are exaggerating how common it is' kind of argument? ""Wait isn't HAT police? Don't you mean YAT? I recall YAT being real military force, whilst HAT being more police. ""Holy shit that gun kicks like a mule, the whole truck got lifted in the air for a second. Not to mention being on the receiving end of 155mm.""I don\u2019t think their special forces are any special at all, it takes tradition which they have none.""It means that when you train some guys for a  few months and give them equipment, it does not make them an army, certainly not special forces.""Not much of a problem, just misuse of the term.""I dunno dude \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nI'm no aeronautical engineer, nor do I have any real knowledge on the landing requirements of the C-5. \n\nAll I know is that the GE CF6 family of turbofan engines provide unbelievable power for aircraft, but are also as unbelievably complicated. \n\nThe C-5 is a monstrosity in aviation, but also a monstrosity to engineer. Probably also a monstrosity to pilot and maintain lol.\n\nThe bigger the more complicated it gets (usually at least). \n\n""Nope fuck that, nope nope nope. \n\nI've watched videos of humans getting shot at point blank by AA guns, I've seen videos  people being skinned alive, even those two Turkish soldiers getting burned alive left me without feeling much, if anything.\n\nBut this, holy fuck, nope, I was only able to see 1 second and closed it already.  \n\nWho the flying fuck burns a puppy dude, I mean how fucking sick does one need to be. Holy shit. "" This is one sick psychopath, such godless people are everywhere, in every in country and in any profession. \n\nThere was an incident in 2013 or something were two Turkish conscripts cut the ears of a dog and kicked it around, in 2004 two US soldiers (Marines IIRC) in Afghanistan/Iraq tossed a puppy off a cliff. \n\nFucked up people are everywhere, you cant blame the whole military just because some soldiers of them have (severe) issues. \n\n\n""Thankfully the ratio is indeed 1:10.000, like you said only the negatives are shown. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if many SAA personal have dogs as pets or just love them like any other person.

""Did they come from Turkey?""No, they were not.""&gt;say I\u2019ve been desensitized to violence and that shit isn\u2019t good.\n\nSame, both from videos online, and stuff in real life. ""&gt; Please learn to see the world without your male white privilege tinted glasses you bigot.\n\nwhat? why tho?  \n\n/u/TheVainOrphan never made a statement about how Syrians view this. \n\n&gt; surely the average syrian wouldnt find it normal?\n\nThats why he/she asked if this was normal. He/she never assumed anything. ""For me personally I find the intention of great importance. \n\nThose examples I've mentioned are with two factions that had ill intentions (ISIS executing POWs, cartel members skinning another cartel member). I understand how bad this is supposed to be, but I dont mind these people killing each other. Nor do I mind seeing them being killed on HD camera footage. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAn innocent dog with no ill intention, barking for attention and love. I mean that is really disgusting. Same goes for pedophiles/child molestors, touching/killing the purest and most innocent of us all.\n\nI don't mind people with ill intentions killing each other, but when the innocent are hurt (be it animals or humans), that really hurts. ""This is according to my Syrian friend \n\n\n&gt;The one filming said \" boss this is the one (dog) who barked on Habiba ( girl name )\n\nForm the dialogue it appears as if the asshole is actually the commander of the soldier filming. Possibly even an officer :/ ""They shoukd also be able to if they so choose so.\n\nSome women will undoubtly be better off abandoning the children by the sound of it but others may carry regret as a burden for a very long time. The point is that the choice is taken away from them by their community and not because the community wants these women to not carry burdens but because they don't want to accept \"daeshi babies\". It would be a constant reminder for the community. ""Not happening with the americans there. Just not happening.""Anything except this. Turkey is not going to get into direct armed conflict with the United States.\n\nThe only way this happens is if Americans/coalition pulls out of these places like the Russians did in Afrin.""I think I've had enough /r/scw for the day.""Some Turkish sources are claiming three YPG members got killed by Kobra APC (TTZA) fire. A video might surface if this is true. ""Probably because the YPG/J has send quite some reinforcements to the Haijin pocket , to assist their DeZMC allies. \n\nMeaning less resistance should the Turkish military invade/attack (which I doubt happening with the current US/French presence in the area). \n\n\n""If the SDF/YPG run into more failures in DeZ it will impact their usefulness for the US. When Turkey threatens the border it might lead to the YPG deciding to dedicate more resources to reinforcing there, instead of supporting the DeZ offensive. Which is exactly what Turkey wants, of course.\n\nThese aren't really high stakes games for Turkey. Just the loss of a few shells but the YPG will be in careful consideration of their actions. ""&gt;and at least let SDF liberate the ISIS strip before they decide to attack the north.\n\nAnd face more resistance? War is all about exploiting the enemies/other sides weakness. With the SDF fighting on a  active front, they will have a major issue with resources and numbers, thus a perfect moment to strike for the Turks. ""Of course it will be spun like that by Turkey. That's the whole intention of shelling the YPG. I'm even willing to bet that that particular vehicle was parked there as bait for atgms. It's very easy to get non-state actors in that corner.""Nothing confirmed as of yet, seemed like a parked unimog unarmored truck. \n""It's a perfect situation for the Turks. The SDF is faced with a dilemma (should the Turks invade).\n\n That means the SDF has to reallocate it's resources to either fight ISIS in Hajin, win from them but lose to the Turks. (With the US stepping in quickly)\n\nOr they stop the Haijin battle (once again) to fight of the Turks, potentially lose US support, leading to a mass Turkish invasion. The Turkish invasion without US support leading to a massive meat grinder leading to heavy casualties for the SDF (looking at the 1:30 ratio in Olive Branch, for every Turkish soldier killed 30 YPG/J member were killed) \n\nEither way, a victory for the Turks. ""I'm sorry but this is hilarious, they couldn't even manage the hold the line let alone capture territory so what does pausing military operations mean? Will they stop defending their territory from ISIS now on? Because that's next.""Really sucks that they stopped the operation , especially after the DeZMC fiasco. But I suppose the Turkish aggression is an existential threat towards the SDF, unlike the Haijin pocket. \n\nThis probably was already the goal of Turkish military, to get some response from the SDF. \n\nBefore everyone goes \"TURKEY = DAESH\", it's not about ISIS, it's about the SDF. If anyone else would've been fighting ISIS in the Haijin pocket, say the Iraqi army or the SAA, Turkey would've have given a rats ass about ISIS. \n\nNow that its the SDF doing the fighting, and Turkey viewing the SDF/YPG (according to them the SDF = the YPG) as the Syrian branch of the PKK (not saying I agree), they will do whatever they can to confront the YPG(or in their eyes the PKK).\n\nThe only thing that keeps the SDF away from total annihilation/operation by the Turks is/are the coalition forces(mainly the US). Now don't come up with the bullshit that the SDF is capable of fighting off the Turks, their not and everyone knows (having an air force really helps, and also tanks that aren't T-55/T-62s). \n\nThe only reason the US/coalition is there is because of ISIS (oh and obviously limiting Iranian influence), the moment the SDF quits fighting ISIS and focuses on Turkey. The Turkish government has \"leverage\" against the US/coalition. (Not that I really agree with this either, but well)\n\nNow the question is, is the US willing to pull out, and leave the Kurds to the wrath and destruction of the Turks, or will they stay and cock the Turks? I dunno, either way Iran is cocked, both the US and Turks will block/limit Iranian influence in the region. \n\nRussia however might build/increase ties with Turkey, should the US stay. Again no clue, we shall see. ""YPG is a greater threat to Turkey than ISIS.""By creating a sand storm?""Being defeated by a small ISIS pocket was hardly an offensive anyway.""ES and OB zones are much more likely to submit to eventual central governance than US backed YPG areas. Especially when in the worst case scenario Turkey will just pull back their forces and close the border and let the Russians go at it.\n\nThe likelyhood of this scenario seems to be increasing as time goes by and the YPG seem to be content in controlling eastern Syria under US protection. \n\n""They want to get rid of the PKK as well. Many islamist groups view Kurdish apoist aligned groups as atheist blasphemers that should not control Syrian lands and would gladly fight them. Especially when there's pay involved. ""Even in its death throes ISIS manages to surprise. Them being a horrible barbaric inhuman group doesn't make their successes and combat prowess any less impressive.""It perfectly justifies, Turkey will not let this thread to get bigger just beyond her border.""Because they worship PKK\u2019s leader, there are thousands of ex-PKK in their ranks, they call Turkey\u2019s southeast \u201cnorthern kurdistan\u201d, is that enough?""There is no \u201cnorthern kurdistan\u201d, there is only Republic of Turkey which is recognized by all countries in the world and her borders are defined by agreements with her neighbor countries.\n\nIf you try to claim Turkey\u2019s rightful territory with ethnic bullshit tales, then you will be a legitimate for Turkish Armed Forces that is obligated to protect Turkey\u2019s integrity.""I gave you the motivation for why Turkey would do that. You seem to ignore it or are uncapable of understanding it. The reason Turkey extended such great efforts to keep their influence in Syria is so they can use that same influence as a bargaining chip to deal for the future.\n\nYou might not understand the significance of the perception that Turkey has on the YPG so I'll try to put it in simple terms. Turkey views the YPG and its affiliations as more problematic than ISIS or Assad.\n\nWhat the Russians did in Afrin for Turkey. Turkey might do for the Russians in Idlib and N. Aleppo. It's nearing the endgame.""People of Turkey have self determined in 1923 already.""Turkey is not based on ethnicity.""The Russians could diplomatically freeze out the SDF and by extention include the regime in this. I'm really going in deep now but consider the last remnant of ISIS gone and look at a map of Syria. There are massive amounts of lands in YPG hands. Turkey might back off of Syria in return for a zero tolerance policy towards YPG from Russia and Assad. We can't really say how much that's worth but it might play a role if and when the US is looking to make an exit out of Syria. ""You should ask them.""both sides are ready, ball is with the U.S now.\n""Not their land?\n\nOk this \"sykes-picot exists therefore there is no such thing as being Syrian\" is such a meme. Why isn't it someone from Aleppo or Idlib's land?""You talkin bout Kurds butchering Armenians, right?\n\nReal sad stuff, wish never happened.""You can explain your point instead of being condescending. I read it again and frankly, either you have no point or are poor with written rhetoric ""YPG is a tool, Turkey will fight them wherever they can and this will lead to the rapid expansion of the Syrian opposition until Turkey feels it is sufficient to fight Assad's forces.""Proxy war.""SAA? Give me a brake SAA would be completely gone without Russian and Iranian support. FSA has Turkish support and protection and the Turkish NATO approved army is certainly stronger than Assad's forces.  ""It is a middle eastern tradition."
