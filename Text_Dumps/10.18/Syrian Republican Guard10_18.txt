"They used far more planes in Afghanistan and Iraq than Russia in Syria. Next.""What will the real response be?""Mohsen Razae kinda looks like Steven Segal.""Problem is that US couldn\u2019t do a Russian style intervention in Iraq or Afghanistan. US couldn\u2019t use foreign proxies in Iraq and Afghanistan for example.""You think these people aren't being forced to act through terror?""Makes me want to put on my Rhodesian combat short shorts and go to Idlib to buy one. $65 dollars is incredible deal.""I thought it was decent, could have used more then just overhead drone footage but good nonetheless ""They didn't destroy S-200s, they won't destroy S-300s. Of course unless they want Russia to provide Syria with S-400s.""If the US criticises it then it's a good thing. ""&gt; which is entirely under government control\n\nSo? Its a humanitarian organization and provides aid to Syrians. Whats so bad about that?""&gt;  It\u2019s been reported that the regime pockets a substantial portion of the aide money for itself.\n\nSource? I'm not trying to be a denialist but if you show a source I would totally agree with you then.""Doesn\u2019t seem like a very intelligent move.""They learn all of that in school.""That\u2019s awful. Syrian people need aid.""Ok that\u2019s understandable.""Malhama tacticool is that, tacticool. Their training is pointless. SAA is trained by real Russian Army.""You think Saddam wouldn\u2019t be affected by Arab spring?""They would develop regardless. Look at how many radical Islamist groups developed in Syria after Arab spring. Saddam would suffer the same problem.""What he wrote in the beginning wasn't differing political views, it was propaganda.""I don't understand the appeal of fighting in sandals over sneakers or boots. Wouldn't their feet be more easily injured?""Considering how incompetent Arab armies are, I wouldn't be surprised if we saw ISIS bloom under Saddam and Assad, unless US intervened.""In Canada too.""You're acting like Assad is gonna literally arrest every single person living in Idlib and put them in Aushwitz style camps.\n\nPeople like you were talking about some grand massacre that would happen if SAA took back Aleppo from jihadists back in late 2016. Nothing of that sort happened.""They are very delusional if they think they can overthrow the government now.""Jihadi competition is fierce. Of course they'll fight ISIS.\n\nYou think rebels fight ISIS because they're \"good guys\"? Think again. HTS is same salafist brand of radical Islam as ISIS and Jaish Izza is only slightly less radical, but they want to compete for power, obviously.""Are you deleting this post?""Jerk. ""I hope the Russians start picking off the rebel tanks, APC's, artillery, etc. with their air assets. Would the Turks end up supplying the rebels with new heavy weaponry though? I know they give them armoured vehicles, anti-tank weapons, and light arms.""Pol Pot =/= Bashar Assad""Is US military \"Trump's forces\"? No? Then neither is SAA.""Immigrating to the US, refugee or not, is and was incredibly difficult. ""They aren't wanted or needed in Canada. I want Assad to deal with them.""Most of those legal immigrants are family based. So its pretty unfair as its hereditary.""Canada for example takes in a far balanced number of family and normal immigrants. About 50/50.""Are they that desperate for money? Or is this individual commanders or gangs trying to enrich themselves?""Does this mean Operation Idlib Dawn can still happen?""Anyone you don\u2019t like is a Russian troll... come on dude.""Saudi medieval style monarchy is worse than Assad.""How was he killed? Arty?""Morsi was worse. He was a Muslim Brotherhood dictator.""They are not welcome in Syria anymore. Good riddance.""The more al Qaeda affiliates trained, the greater risk to the west. USAF should air strike this \u201ctraining camp\u201d.""You can buy flir cameras on eBay. This isn\u2019t top secret military equipment.""US should have done a Yugoslavia/Libya style air campaign to help the rebels win back when they were still moderate and fighting for freedom, not Islam.""Yep. And the Turkish proxies in charge of Afrin are really inept at counter insurgency. They don't raid YPG safehouses and weapons caches (They do however raid civilian homes for loot and taking hostages for ransom).""Tactical sandals.""No recoil though.""How do you stop something that hasn't begun in the first place?""&gt; I think foreign supporters of the Syrian regime tend to see all jihadi factions as part of a faceless monolithic mass who are basically the same as HTS or Daesh\n\nBecause they're not all that different from each other. Why should we care?""IDF soldiers?""What does \"infiltration\" mean in this case? Like ninja sneaky infiltration or a very small scale offensive?""&gt; Hama in the 80ies\n\n1. The war in the 80s Hama was way smaller\n\n2. Muslim Brotherhood didn't receive TOW shipments so SAA could use tanks more easily at that time.\n\nWouldn't matter if Hafez was in power today. Syria was at the mercy of USA/The West.""Better name would have been \"And Incite the RuAF Operations Room\".""1000 SAA/Defense Company soldiers were killed in Hama 1982. This is far from a cakewalk massacre against defenceless Muslim Brotherhood members.""They planning something big?""How long did the shaddadi mosque stop the advance of SDF for?""Thank you for your service. ""Absolute unit""Turks too lazy to chop down some trees?""Probably 1. Maybe 10 shanty's.\n\nEDIT: Why are people downvoting? Houses cost a lot to build and this statue isn't made of gold.""Why are SAA offensives slow? Usually 1 village per day, 2 max and sometimes even a 3 day pause but no grand breakthroughs that mechanized forces are supposed to do.""Not related to the question but mods, why is it when I made a post asking about the state of the SAA it got taken down, but this is ok?""He looks mutilated.""Well the title says he was assassinated only a \"few days ago\" so didn't think it would be from decomposition.""Sorry didn't know about modmail. ""4 years. ""No its Raqqa that is hypocrisy. USA bashing SyAF for \"indiscriminate bombing\" and barrel bombs while USAF levels Raqqa with PGMs.""Idlib agreement is temporary. SAA is using the time to rebuild its units and get more conscripts.""That wouldn't and shouldn't make a difference if this area was properly combed **a year ago** by the US. They could have just turned this strip of villages into a big crater if they wished so. Civilians? So what? That didn't stop them from destroying Mosul and Raqqa.""No such thing as \"monkey model\" M1A1s. Literally the only difference between export M1A1 and US M1A1 is lack of DU armor, everything else is the same.""Maybe because this is US propaganda? This wouldn't help Assad in the slightest and I don't think he is retarded.""They have, but it is not on a systematic aushwitz level western propaganda would like you to think its been done. What those government soldiers/militiamen did was highly illegal and not state sanctioned. US soldiers have raped and murdered civilians in Iraq, does this mean its institutional and that Bush condoned it? Of course not.""ISIS counter offensive is winning conventionally (but will be stopped. This is more like the Bulge than Tet.""US forces would absolutely fare better. Where SDF would run and get routed, US Army/Marines would hold the line. US soldiers have better training and high morale.""&gt; you would have alot of dead Americans.\n\nNo you wont.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Najaf_(2003)\n\nUS forces faced Fedayeen Saddam + Syrian Islamists who were just as nuts/fearless as ISIS. Iraqi paramilitaries were slaughtered and US forces suffered very low losses.""Not being able to go out at night without getting ambushed by Wrath of Olives insurgents is total control? ""Fedayeen Saddam ran into murderous tank and machine gun fire, sometimes climbed tanks and had to be taken out by tank crewman with handgun.\n\nhttps://www.financialexpress.com/archive/the-battle-for-kifl/77114/""Oh I didn't even know you were a OIF veteran. Which unit were you in?""I did see the Niger ambush video. Those were lightly armed special forces heavily outnumbered being ambushed. Doubt that would happen in Hajin.""So you went into Iraq after the fall of Baghdad?""Yeah and Saudi M1A2s are also very good. Good electronics and other modern gadgets some US models don't have. I'm sick and tired of the \"monkey model\" excuse for Iraqi/Saudi Abrams getting wacked.""Yeah I saw on Wikipedia saying first elements of 3rd Cavalry entered Iraqi on April 25th. Just wanted to confirm with actual veteran. \ud83d\ude42\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why fedayeen didn\u2019t fight as hard as before Baghdad fell?""The entire 11th Armored Division?""Rape and mutilation only increases and pisses off opposition. ""???\n\nIdlib\n\nAnd the war COULD ignite again. Anyone with common sense understands that.""Well we on this sub watch a lot of humans getting killed, often brutally (ISIS and Islamists). Rarely do we see dogs getting killed so we find it more revolting as we aren't used to seeing that.""How do you know it was a populated area? For all we know it could have been an empty farm field or forest.""Or on jihadists.""I wonder how the SAA got the intel.""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Medusa\n\nOhh nooo 512 Taliban killed vs 17 coalition killed. So horrible D:\n\nI'm not gonna bother putting up Vietnam casualties because that would not accurately represent a Hajin battle with US forces involved. Technology has come a very long way since the 60s.""I hope he gets treated decently. Also, this could trigger a response from SAA.""Only 35th Mechanized Brigade has T-90s so I don't think so. Definitely Abrams though \ud83d\ude0e""Will there be a ground invasion by Turkey?""Clashes with small arms or just artillery strikes?""Nice username \ud83d\ude02""Everyone in the SAA should get those. Seeing Republican Guard soldiers wearing civilian clothes is sad."
