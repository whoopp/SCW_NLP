This is not a democracy.\n\nSumming up the PYD rule in Syria as a democracy makes as much sense as iterating that the People's Republic of China and Democratic People's Republic of Korea are democracies.\n\n""Politicians that are elected into offices can actually determine whether the federal uniformed services of the United States can or cannot conduct duties related to governance and law enforcement inside the borders of individual states here in the US.\n\nWithout explicit permission of the local elected officials, federal military cannot conduct domestic police work.

That's silly.""There's no irony here. Just in case you were unable to discern the difference, I've made no claims. I just posted an article I came upon on the Internet. In contrast, /u/Voltairinede made a personal claim definitively stating that the events described in the article I posted did not take place. I asked how he is backing up his own claim and he failed to provide any answer that'd pass the smell test besides pointing out the source is not pro-YPG or the YPG itself.""&gt; photographic evidence\n\nThis is not a mass incident such as a bombing, shelling or a street protest, of which photographic evidence can be obtained easily. The article claims a certain 18-year-old individual by the name of Abdullah al-Suwaidan was summarily executed by the SDF for smuggling oil.\n\nI'm sorry, but neither the lack of photographic evidence or your apparent personal emotional response because the source is not a YPG operated or a pro-YPG news outlet can constitute any proof that might counter the the claim the article makes. ""&gt;To be fair, how does one prove that something didn't happen. It's technically impossible.\n\nWe don't know conclusively if Abdullah al-Suwaidan was executed by the SDF or not, and without more information to the contrary it is a mistake and a fallacy to definitively state the event describe did not take place.""A mix of both, actually. I'd actually dare say knee-jerk reactions to situational developments, mixed with vague political goals and often superficial calculus that is obviously estranged from the facts on the ground. That is all applied on the backdrop of several federal government agencies and institutions which pursue different agendas and often end up clashing among themselves. Ask anyone that has experience working with various branches and agencies of the U.S. government, and the answer you are going to get is bound to be similar.\n\nWe are going through even worse times because we so very evidently lack an administration that ideally could have established some sense of coordination among the executive branch.""&gt;They seem to do this and that and see what sticks.\n\nGiven the present chaos that prevails over the executive branch, that too could be a sensible assessment of our state of affairs.""&gt;Nedaa is unreliabale to say at least, complete fake news.\n\nNot sure if you are making this claim out of your personal bias, or a demonstrable and well established history of Nedaa pushing fake news.

Turks can easily have peace with the PKK.\n\nThe allied powers could have easily had a cease fire with the Germany during the WW2 if only they could have completely acquiesced to the German demands of lebensraum and raw resources.\n\n&gt;Erdogan ended the ceasefire because it plays well to a Turkish nationalists to boost his popularity for elections\n\nIt is a good example of reductio ad absurdum to reduce the PKK's campaign against Turkey to Erdogan's presidency. As far as I know, the PKK's attacks against Turkey far predates Erdogan taking office, and strong Turkish sentiments against the PKK (similar to the sentiment Americans have against the Al Qaeda) that I even witnessed to be prevalent among the Kurds of Turkey have nothing to do with Erdogan.\n\nI can understand that your argument is the narrative the PKK disseminates, yet the timeline of the events suggests that it was actually the PKK which derailed the peace process. According to the Kurdish academic Arzu Yilmaz, the PKK attempted to turn the limited urban upheaval the PKK instigated after the derailment of the peace process to a tactical advantage over Turkey to halt what the PKK saw as an imminent Turkish intervention against the PKK obtaining land holdings in Syria. Essentially the PKK realized that they managed to hold territories (although in Syria, not in Turkey) for the first time since they first started their attacks against Turkey in 1984, and they sought to protect that status quo from a Turkish intervention as Turks would naturally understand the PKK holding ground in Syria would only bolster future attacks against Turkey.\n\nI get that you might be some sort of activist that sees himself on a quest to push the PKK's narrative around and to garner the PKK some sympathy, but the mere knowledge of the timeline behind the derailment of the peace process disproves the strange narrative you seem to have subscribed to.""&gt; I don\u2019t even know where to start. There was so much fake news in the past coming from this news website that I stopped reading it. Even this article is BS. And I really don\u2019t want to advocate for SDF/YPG. Im not their supporter.\n\nIf you could actually answer and start somewhere, I think everyone here would appreciate that and get an opportunity to see and discern for ourselves the credibility of Nedaa.""&gt;I should go around and claim that the turkish police has executed someone and when people ask for proof I just say \"can you prove that it didn't happen hehe?\"\n\nIt depends. Your claim could be taken seriously if you could provide an actual name, location and the names of those who are involved, which could in turn all be cross-checked easily through other venues. \n\nPerhaps you haven't realized this, but the article provides such details, and your example doesn't.""I think we will see more of these over due course, because the previously disseminated narrative of Arabs being fine and dandy under the rule of a group of Kurdish left-wing radicals of the KCK (which actually some Kurds join and support because of Kurdish irredentism) being inclusive of Arabs and others was hilariously outlandish.""We handed this over to ISIS the moment we decided to take the Syrian branch of the KCK (a radical Kurdish, far-left entity) as a partner to push back ISIS control over Arab regions. It was obvious from the get go that the Arab majority of Syria would not take Kurdish rule and radical, far-left ideology imposed onto them well.""&gt; If so, SDF should choose an arabic governor for Raqqa, if they have not done that. Raqqa is not a kurdish city, it is arabic city, arabs should govern themselves. I can't understand how they are oppressed. Is it because they feel like they are treated as ISIS suspects?\n\nThey feel oppressed and marginalized because even with the Arab council members the PYD hand picks to create a fake window dressing of an inclusive polity and Arab acceptance of the rule of a radical, far-left Kurdish entity, it is still the cadres of the KCK (of which the PYD is a part of) who are calling the shots on the ground and not any Arabs who are seen untrustworthy by the cadres.""&gt;An actual Arab-Kurdish conflict can result in a disaster, not only in Raqqa, but also among SDF ranks.\n\nThis has been long reported by the neutral sources that were present on the ground. There aren't really any Arab politicians with actual power or any Arab commanders who aren't subject to the command of the Kurdish cadres of the KCK.\n\n""The US never sent forces to fight for the Tsar. In fact the US avoided getting deeply involved in the Russian Civil War because it disliked the absolutist sympathies of Admiral Kolchak, one of the major White leaders. There were, of course, more democratic and liberal Whites as well.\n\n&gt; the US allied with Hirohito instead of putting him on trial, he died on the throne in the 1980s after presiding over the atrocities they committed all over Asia\n\nHirohito died a powerless figurehead, stripped of authority and basically isolated from Japanese politics. The actual leaders of Japan in WWII, the military men, were tried and executed.\n\nI recommend doing some more study in history before getting into these debates.""As long as you ignore the fact that the violence in **Iraq** has a sectarian element to it, and ignore that Sunnis in Iraq aren\u2019t happy with the current state of affairs, things will just get worse.\n\nMentioning that Sunni extremism exists all over the world doesn\u2019t explain why it was so virulent and successful in Iraq. It\u2019s because Sunnis were so angry at the Iraqi gov\u2019t they initially treated ISIS as liberators.""You sound almost excited for there to be more violence, it\u2019s disgusting. You don\u2019t think Sunni Arabs, who make up 20% of the population, deserve an Iraq that works for them?""Yes, because I recognize that Iraqi Sunnis might have some legitimate grievances, that makes me a genocide denier.\n\nPlease, try intellectual honesty for a change.""&gt; Yes the US did fight for the Tsar, 11k soldiers worth\n\nThis is straight up, factually not true. You restating it doesn\u2019t make it less false. The Tsar was gone in March 1917, months before the US even joined the war.\n\n&gt; figureheads still matter, they're also figureheads to their victims as well.\n\nBut they weren\u2019t really Hirohito\u2019s victims, that\u2019s the point. Hirohito was just a puppet. It was thus more acceptable to ensure Japanese submission at the war\u2019s end by keeping the Emperor in a nominal role; removing him outright likely would have led to the war continuing.\n\nJust repeating yourself is not a compelling argument.""No, Hazara in Afghanistan are targetted because they\u2019re Shia and ISIS is anti-Shia. That\u2019s why so many Iraqi Sunnis sides with ISIS, they were angry and frustrated with the Shia-dominated government, and ISIS capitalized on and radicalized that anger.\n\nThis really isn\u2019t difficult, it\u2019s pretty common knowledge actually. Unfortunately you find it far easier to generalize Sunnis as a bunch of bloodthirsty brutes who just like to murder Shia.""If the current course continues, yes. Any time a civil war ends with the pre-war status quo being maintained, another conflict is inevitable. This is because the grievances that started the conflict still have not been either resolved or rendered moot.\n\n""&gt; Very few people are willing to put their lives on the line for political freedom\n\nThis has been proven false so many times, and authoritarians still restate it.\n\nTell me, why do you think this?""Hama turned out pretty badly as well.""People tried peaceful political change. They were shot.""The joint British, American and French strike. Where they struck airbases and research facilities.

Be serious here.\n- Many of the rebels weren\u2019t Islamic radicals, just ordinary Syrians tired of a corrupt, elitist, and authoritarian government.\n- Most rebel fighters are Syrian, not foreign fighters. The same is true of Assad\u2019s forces, which also have tens of thousands of foreign fighters- Palestinians, Lebanese, Afghans, and Iraqis.""I\u2019m going to question the reliability of this until further notice.""It was that or ISIS.

The majority Sunni population thus felt/feels the government isn\u2019t representative of them.""&gt;If you look at the massive increase in civilian casualties after Trump took, including strikes on large apartment building's, it's very easy to speculate something changed.\n\nI appreciate your unsubstantiated opinion and desire to turn this into a partisan issue, but I've seen no real difference in US foreign policy since GW Bush.""First of all, we routinely under report civilian casualties, so numbers are going to be off regardless.  Second, I'm glad you've found a website you agree with.  However, I have never heard of it so imho it's dubious at best.  Either way, if your aim is to suggest Democrats are somehow better than Republicans, your position falls on deaf ears.  Neither old party cares about peace, civilians or what's best for the average American.""&gt;Because you've never heard of it, then it's dubious?\n\nIMHO stands for in my humble opinion.  I did not attempt to make a statement of fact.\n\n&gt;It's the premier source in this war used to track the civilian casualties by airstrikes.\n\nWho says?\n\n&gt;If you've followed this war for any length of time I find it hard to imagine you've never came across it, as it's posted here either in its own thread, or sourced in comments very frequently\n\nI've followed it since the beginning of the war, and like I said, I've never heard of it.  Besides, I take all sources with a grain of salt as a rule.  It has been my undeniable experience that each \"news\" organization has a bias and an agenda.  That's because they are all run by humans, and all humans have biases and agendas.  Surely you can appreciate this fact of life.\n\n&gt;I'm sorry you haven't heard of it, but I've seen supporters of all sides in this cite it frequently, and it's almost universally seen as an accurate indicator, being sourced for major news organizations as well.\n\nI appreciate your anecdote and impossible to verify opinion. \n\n&gt;Now, my position isn't about Democrats or Republican's at all, I'm not American and could care less about which party.\n\nAh, so you are the disinterested third party.  I've seen this meme before.\n\n&gt;What I care about is the facts of the matter, and it's a literal fact that the civilian casualties increased dramatically after the current administration took office as opposed to the latter.\n\nSo you preferred the latter administration then...even though, as you say, you are not an American, and as you suggest, have no dog in this fight so to speak?  Just the facts mam eh Sgt Dano?\n\n&gt;Both killed large amount of civilians and caused problems in the region, one caused more deaths at a much higher rate though.\n\nThis is precisely my point.  Whether Trump murdered more civilians or Obama murdered more civilians is largely irrelevant, because the reality is American foreign policy has continuously led to the murder of civilians.  Is Bush the top murderer ala the Iraq war?  Is Obama the top murderer via a hugely ramped up and secretive drone strike program?  Is Trump the king murderer of civilians based on this particular attack and others?  I think your argument is largely irrelevant when placed in the context of American foreign policy since 9/11/2001.\n\ntl;dr: You're off in the weeds.  ""&gt;Just because you have never heard of airwars doesnt invalidate it as a source\n\nI never suggested otherwise.  IMHO means in my humble opinion.

That's a fact.  You shouldn't pretend this source is any different in that regard.  Non partisan?  Lol.""&gt;Well you certainly did suggest that when you told the other poster \"well done you found a website that agrees with you\" please dont backtrack now you have been called out for your own ignorance.\n\nAnd don't mis-characterize my statements.  I provided an opinion and couched it as such.  I never made a statement of fact, but that is precisely what you and the other poster are attempting to do.  Fascinating indeed.  Sorry if both you and the other poster lacked the reading comprehension to see that.  There is no backtracking on my part.  I still hold the opinion.  In fact, it has since grown stronger thanks to you and the other poster.  There is not a \"news\" source on this planet which is above reproach.  Anyone who suggests otherwise is likely selling something\n\n&gt;Airwars simply is a bodycount website nothing more nothing less.\n\nAnd it relies on data which is provided from other sources.  It does not have unfettered direct access to the necessary information.\n\n&gt;For someone who had never even heard of them until other people had to tell you about it you suddenly are an expert on their biases and agendas. Fascinating.\n\n**Two** other people.  Not exactly a majority or even a plurality on Reddit or this sub.  Even if 10-20 more people chimed in it would not establish this site as above reproach, because no \"news\" site is above reproach.

Killed in 2012.\n- Col. Hafez Makhlouf, head of General Security Directorate, cousin of Bashar al-Assad.\n- Rami Makhlouf, Syrian billionaire who controls a vast business empire, comprising over half of the Syrian economy.

I don't think there are that many foreigners fighting along with the YPG either. This is in stark contrast with the Spanish Civil War which saw thousands of foreigners fighting hand alongside the Spanish left.""My german is not so good so somethings might be translated wrong\n\nSyria: The small worldwar and the arab problem.\n\n**Too little economic productivity for too large dependency on excessive population to mount with state subvention than cause of conflict **\n\n\"the near-east is the doomed setting\", called so at the beginning of a series from short-messages by ehsani2. \"Egypt alone must manage 700,000 jobs every year, with the new job-seekers Egypt has to absorb into its population of 98 million. \"Every year\" which stresses the problem.\n\nThe problem is probably too big. A third of Egypt now lives under the poverty line, earning less than a dollar a day, ends the first tweet.\n\nEhsani2 is an interested observer of the near-east. The Syrian-American banker author since 2006, has also for the past 5 years wrote about the outbreak of violence in Syria, contributes for the blog Syria Comment, by American Joshua Landis, Middle East expert.\n\nThe first article for Syria Comment by Ehsani2, written on February 2006, had Hugo Chavez as the topic, and asked, if the \"alternative economy\" for Syria was interesting or advantageous. His answer was clear, Syria didn't need more state intervention, rather less.\n\nThat is a position, that Ehsani2 then later presented as well. Within a year, in April 2017, as the large public media, in the US, Germany, France, Great Britain, Israel, Saudi Arabia, were not always so \"westly\" in reporting, when in Syria the chemical weapons attack happened, Khan Sheichun was very debatable on the topic, made the banker-reader attentive on another fundamental problem, that until this date, barely anything lit up: the excessive government demands through the rise in population in the year of the conflict. The Syrian government had in the year of the outbreak of conflict many false estimates\n""&gt; in both SU and China, the governments were indeed in control pf everything\n\nInaccurate. Decision-making is done by party bodies, government institutions are mostly a facade.\n\n&gt; This is simply western think tankers BS. \n\nNo, actually. As I\u2019ve said before, official positions of power, which you keep referencing, are not as important in Syria as informal networks of power.\n\n&gt; Mustafa Tlass, a Sunni, was the head of MoD from 70s to 2004. his son, Manaf was commander of one of the RG brigades, a one star general.\n\nThis isn\u2019t even a response to anything I said.\n\n&gt; who moved his business from Syria even before the civil war.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this was a lie.\n\nNobody\u2019s claiming that there aren\u2019t Sunnis in positions of power in the Assad government, but it\u2019s an accepted fact that Alawites dominate. The number of positions held by the Alawites is far disproportionate to their demographic size. [Some estimates hold that 80% of Alawites are state employees](http://www.mei.edu/publications/alawi-community-and-syria-crisis#_ftn7). Attempts to claim that the Alawites aren\u2019t in charge are essentially Assadist propaganda.""&gt;Right, and the Palestine Authority should be annihilated because of something about 'history'. Your whole argument is pure hasbara.\n\nNonsense. Violent attacks against Israel do not emanate from Palestinian National Authority. As a matter of fact, Palestinian National Authority was born out of Oslo Accords and specifically Gaza\u2013Jericho Agreement. It is a legitimate, governing entity which enjoys even Israeli recognition. What does the PKK and their violent acts have anything to do with the Palestinian National Authority?\n\nYou're clearly pulling a strawman here, especially considering you specifically seem to have used the term annihilation even though I've said nothing about annihilating a group or a people.\n\n""&gt;Actually when you put things that way I also can't see how PKK are the bad guys.\n\nBecause the PKK enforces a cult-like, dogmatic and radical ideology through violent actions including suicide bombing attacks? I get that you might be feeling sympathetic to the PKK out of a sense of Kurdish nationalism or some personal, ideological left-wing alignment. But objectively speaking, PKK's methods and actions are completely reprehensible and despicable.""&gt; That's not exactly correct. The PKK is the Turkish branch of the KCK, and the PYD is the Syrian branch. The YPG is the militia of the &gt;PYD. The PKK and PYD are sister organizations: the two fall under the Union of the KCK, but are independent. The PYD is not a franchise of the PKK.\n\nThe PKK is the KCK itself. Even their executive councils are made up of the same people.\n\nAfter Abdulla Ocalan's apprehension, in a bid to rebrand themselves and to seek legitimacy, the PKK first renamed itself to Kongra-gel and then the KCK to bundle together various PKK franchises under the same roof. As such, what we generally refer to as the PKK these days actually refer to HPG in Turkey and Northern Iraq. Essentially the PKK as a militant group actually does not exist anymore, it's now named the KCK, and KCK has a bunch of militant franchises around that includes the HPG in Turkey and the YPG in Syria.\n\nIt might come off as a bit confusing, but I suspect that might be by design. After all the PKK started these rebranding efforts to evade the sanctions and ramifications which came along with their international designation as a terror group.\n\n\n\n\n\n""&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdVLMGgdYpg&amp;fbclid=IwAR0mCkw55hlRu7hUZkZmMbvtaZ5fkCwGES57mJ2D3PwNeAhk_0Lyy8oZDVo\n\nYou think the images of what appears to be riot police dispersing a crowd (albeit very harshly) or cracking down a protest constitute purposeful targeting of civilians?

S.T.R.A.T.E.G.I.C spelled like that.""Jeffrey is mostly right on this (hear me out). Take his comments on ISIS for instance. \n\n&gt;The elements of ISIS in the hundreds, probably, saw an opportunity in the total breakdown of civil society and of the upsurge of violence as the population rose up against the Assad regime, and the Assad regime, rather than try to negotiate or try to find any kind of solution, unleashed massive violence against its own population. That created a space for ISIS to recruit people; to protect people to some degree, ironic as it sounds, from the depredations of the Assad regime; and very soon, ISIS had an army of 35,000 troops and had seized big chunks of both Iraq and Syria.\n\nDespite that ISIS started in Iraq and was a result of the U.S. failure to capitalize on gains made there (which he acknowledges), ISIS would never have become nearly as strong as it did if it had not be able to exploit the Syrian civil war (which was overwhelmingly Assad's fault). \n\nThen there is Iran. I am relieved to see that the U.S. acknowledges that Iran was invited in by the Syrian government, which means getting them to leave is part of a political, rather than a military, solution. That is quite a change from the former posturing that coincided with declarations that Iran must leave immediately. Yet, I still find this result to be very unlikely given the blood and treasure that Iran has invested into Syria.\n\nHe is also right that a long-term strategy is needed to keep ISIS from coming back in Iraq and Syria. I am not a fan of the idea that this requires a long-term U.S. presence in Syria, but Jeffrey seems to hold hope that the Russians can help create the conditions for a Syrian political process that makes a U.S. presence unnecessary going forward. This is, of course, a long shot to say the least (especially considering that the Russians weren't even able to get Assad to stop using chemical weapons throughout the war). \n\nYet this is also the most clearly articulated Syrian strategy that I have seen from the U.S. to date. Jeffrey has set the parameters for U.S. involvement far more tightly than I had formerly seen from other administration officials. Makes me a bit hopeful that the U.S. won't be there forever.\n\n""Given the greatly extended timeline just to get combined patrols on the TFSA side of the lines, you should expect a really long wait.""I am speaking about the beginning of the conflict, which was purely indigenous at its onset. Assad made the choice to respond with violence and arrests rather than attempting even half-hearted reforms. The blame for the protests transforming into a civil war lies squarely on him, even if it would not have gotten as bad as it did without external support. ""To be honest, I'm pleasantly surprised by reading these protests are still going on. I was expecting the local council's to either have been disbanded or fully coerced by the TFSA and their demographic by this point. It's more than I expected.""That is true to an extent, but these meager concessions (if we can really call them that) were made at the same time as Assad sent tanks into Syrian cities and began arresting and killing protestors. It isn't correct to say that a violent minority ruined a potential detente that Assad intended to pursue. \n\nAlso, I cannot help but empathize with those \"rebel sympathizers\" that you say have \"spun [the prison release] as a malicious plan to discredit the opposition\" considering Assad's strategy throughout much of the war was to discredit the opposition as terrorists and make life generally unlivable in opposition areas.""Yes. I was expecting that some of the TFSA factions would force impose the islamist viewpoints of the Ghouta refugees, and that the local council's would either be disbanded or forced accept whatever the TFSA faction in that area says. I did not expect there to be civil administration left with the power to decide not to do something that they are opposed to. And I am rather certain that many (or most) of the TFSA factions would be on the Ghouta refugees side here, which is why I am surprised that these type of thing is still going on - though it could just be that whatever faction is in this area isn't islamist.\n\nI'm not saying that this is a good situation, but it isn't as bad as what I expected from the TFSA/Turkey.""&gt; Respectfully, yes - a few users here have outright denied any ties between the YPG and PKK.

KCK is literally the only major Kurdish group in Turkey.\n\nThis is patently false. Back in the day when I started to research the role of Kurds in Turkish society, I've discovered that there are other Kurdish groups and parties in Turkey, and apparently the PKK has a history of suppressing them violently in an attempt to monopolize domestic Kurdish identity based politics.""I only see this claimed by the KCK's media, and obviously I treat it as utter claptrap when I do. Outsiders without sufficient knowledge of Kurds in Turkey tend to believe such fantastic claims of course, but having personally seen thousands of Kurdish speaking village guards in Turkey's Southeast who are organized for the defense of their communities against the PKK attacks has made me skeptical towards similarly extraordinary and unsubstantiated KCK claims. \n\nI do, however, fully understand why the KCK keeps repeating this silly narrative. They probably think whitewashing the despicable legacy of the PKK is paramount to their attempts to seek legitimacy in the eyes of the international community, and what better way to do this other than depicting themselves as victims of some imaginary extermination attempt or genocide?\n\nI personally abhor throwing around claims of genocide and extermination when it's unwarranted, and I find it extremely disrespectful towards the peoples who actually suffered genocide and extermination such as the Jews and the Armenians. However, KCK's falsification of status quo in an attempt to further their vision of Kurdish irredentism is ultimately self-destructive, especially considering how easy it is to access reliable and factual information on this day and age. One doesn't need any special skills  to see and understand Turkey has nearly 20 million of Kurds living as full citizens in all parts of the country. Most of these are Kurdish and Turkish speakers, living fully integrated lives.

These were huge numbers of short term loans that were quickly repaid (think about what this does to the total outstanding) - and on top of that the \u201cdollars lent\u201d figure was often counted many times. Also from that same GAO report, from the explanation under the table where that 16 trillion comes from:\n\n&gt; Table 8 aggregates total dollar transaction amounts by adding the total dollar amount of all loans but does not adjust these amounts to reflect differences across programs in\nthe term over which loans were outstanding. For example, an overnight PDCF loan of $10 billion that was renewed daily at the same level for 30\nbusiness days would result in an aggregate amount borrowed of $300 billion although the institution, in effect, borrowed only $10 billion over 30 days. In contrast, a TAF loan of $10 billion extended over a 1-month period would appear as $10 billion. As a result, the total transaction\namounts shown in table 8 for PDCF are not directly comparable to the total transaction amounts shown for TAF and other programs that made loans for periods longer than overnight.\n\nYou can rant all you want - but it\u2019s still 8.6.""&gt;That doesn\u2019t make them TARP.

The supposed dropping of Marxism by the KCK does not look honest either, it would appear the KCK has chosen to drop Marxism in the aftermath of Soviet Union's fall to garner international support rather than sincerely giving up radical left-wing views.\n\nYour example is not a good one either - entire KCK including the PKK and the PYD are controlled by the original cadres who founded the PKK with Abdulla Ocalan back in the day. I reckon they are the very same people who signed off on PKK's string of terror attacks and various extremist acts which include deliberate and systemic targeting of civilians (including tourists) and urban suicide bombing attacks.\n""What has Turkey done worse that could top off PKK's deliberate targeting of civilians and PKK's celebrated tradition of committing suicide bombings?

They were driving around dressed as civilians, observing and trailing a corrupt official. That makes perfect sense, and I'm not certain why you have this arbitrary skepticism about what is a pretty common anti-criminal espionage tactic in any law enforcement organization.\n\nAs for shooting at policemen, as I already said, that happened when the police tried to arrest them. I don't support it at all (I'm sure you'll ignore that, though), but it was not the random attack you make it out to be. The SAS thought they could get through the checkpoint. They couldn't.  They made a very ill-advised decision (as people often due under pressure) to resist arrest. It makes sense.\n\n&gt; Why would they wait to execute them? They had them in their custody for long enough if thats what they wanted to do. They held them because the SAS were running some shady ops and they wanted info.\n\nInsurgent groups often hold people for a certain amount of time. It's pretty rare for people to be shot the moment they surrender. It's more likely to me that the police held on to them for a while and then handed them over to insurgents when the latter arrived. \n\n&gt; The evidence is that the MOD changed its stories multiple times throughout the ordeal. Every narrative they tried to form was filled with holes (much like the Saudis and the Khashoggi incident) and contradicted by facts on the ground. They had to come up with a new one until they finally rested on the bullshit you are now regurgitating.\n\nAs opposed to the narrative you are now giving, which is based on...? Nothing but your own guesswork and prejudice.\n\nA huge amount of your post is just you being arbitrarily skeptical about things that make sense or are common practice. While I'm sure the MOD's version of events is somewhat whitewashed, there's nothing in the wiki article that sounds overly fishy to me. It all sounds pretty plausible, actually. Much more plausible than \"*Hah, you thought the Coalition was trying to fight the sectarian violence, but they were actually deliberately encouraging it!*\" conspiracy theories.
