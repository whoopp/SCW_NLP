There is more peace in a society that is democratic and does not need violence/suppression to keep itself sustained, like a dicatorship does.\n\n&gt;Nobody gives a rat's ass about the UN-backed \"Libyan government\".

I could have also mentioned [Homs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/life-under-siege-in-homs-syria-1418992127) , while there was no Russian Airforce, it is sufficient to say that destruction of cityscapes occured on each front of this war."" That argument can be turned around very quickly: The tech that is killing Syrians in Syria is Russian. If Russian hardware supplied to the SAA is killing Syrian Rebels, are they then not complicit? But let's not split hairs here, my original point is something else:\n\nBlaming the continuation of the war on only one party means being blind to how this started. The Regime itself is to a big part responsible for creating the conditions that started the protests, and how the protests turned into the war, and not ending the war earlier by negotiation. Look how Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco turned out.\n\nThe Rebels are responsible for turning protests for rule of law, no corruption and a good economy into what it turned out as.\n\nMy point is this: There were protests in all of the Arab world. However the answer to these protests have been different in each country, and with this the outcomes. You can not blame US &amp; Israel for the choices that Assad &amp; Ghadaffi made. Let's compare:\n\n  Morocco: answered protests with government reforms, King is still in power\n\n  Tunisia: answered protests with intial suppression, Ben Ali took his billions out and is now rich in Jeddah, KSA.\n\n  Egypt: suppressed protests, there were rumours that the US threathened to cut the subsidies if the regime would crack down even more; Mubarak resigned/was ousted. Peaceful exchange of power if you compare it to Libya and Syria. Mubarak &amp; sons are free &amp; rich.\n\n  Egypt II: the Muslim Brotherhood under Morsi threatens to install their own dictatorship, heavy protests against them, they get ousted from power. Morsi is now in prison.\n\n  Libya: Gadaffi responds to the protests with violence, parts of his army &amp; government defect, almost crushes the revolution after a military campaign. Warehouses full of bodies get found. After an Intervention Gadaffi ends up dead. Destruction of some cities.\n\n  Syria: The regime answers the protests with violence, only gets held in power by Hezbollah, Iran &amp; Russia. 7 year long war, many times longer than any other country. Much more destruction, rise of ISIS. Most gains are made after a strategy of reconciliation agreements is implemented.\n\nWhat I want to say is: Each time the regime decided to use force, their country went down with them in proportion to how much force was used. It is obvious that the choice of the regimes on how to answer the protests is in a part responsible for the ensuing actions.""First of all, please understand that I don't want to insult you and that I am very interested in this conversation. I see your irritation, and I too always feel it when someone contradicts me, this makes me always say \"You are wrong, I am right.\" I appreciate that you are here to discuss with me.\n\nThe whole Arab spring reminds me of the [Spring of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848) in 1848, in which many European countries experienced revolutions against monarchy in favour of nationalism and democracy. It was a movement between a common cultural region and all revolutions failed and were crushed.\n\nThen as now this did not start because it was necessarily bad, but because there could have been something better. Yeah of course Syria was peaceful, but what if it could have been peaceful AND with less corruption and a better economy? As I said, it is the fault of the rebels (and their backers, you are right in this) to turn it into the islamist thing that it is today. However, I hope we agree that almost no one went to the street in 2011 to make it into what it is today.\n\n&gt;Imagine doing that in Europe\n\nThey actually did that, in 1989 / 1990 with the fall of Communism. Then too there were huge masses on the street that wanted better economic conditions, free movement, and an end to the dictatorship. The masses were against the political system of the last 50 years and took the propaganda of the mortal enemy. Across Europe, there were different levels of chaos, economic crashes and new dictatorships forming (Belarus) or success (Czechia). Then as now, the level of violence was an indication of the path a country takes (Romania vs Yugoslavia). See how [Nazarbayev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev) is still in office of Kazakhstan and Yugosvlavia does not exist as a country anymore.\n\nBahrain is a very good counterpoint and you are right in this one.\n\n&gt; UN resoultions\n\nThe UN security council has China and Russia as veto members - this means they can stop everything at once. This means the West does not have power. Also, you say not a single resolution condemning Yemen but then you say the same happened with Russia and Syria - so that makes it even, no?\n\n\nIn the end, I don't want to say ALL blame is on the Regime. But this Regime is not an angel saint - it was the government which had the chance to change things and did not. Notice how China, Iran, Sudan, Algeria are all with a lot of inner conflict and many enemies but managed to keep their people happy enough. Every nation has plans to attack every other nation - this is the job of the military and the secret service. Syria had their hands for a long time in Lebanon.""Hey,\n\nthank you for your detailed answer.
