A relationship can be mutually beneficial and this is an example. \n\nBut in the end SDF is just a tactical short term ally whereas Turkey is a long term strategic ally. SDF just offers nothing that Turkey can't offer but better. The US has already shown they don't care about working with oppressive religious countries, look at the KSA, so even if Erdogan was to go full Islamic Dictator and not give up power, that's not an issue as long as he is friendly enough with the US.""In a hostile country surrounded by a population that hates us outside of that one small group of people who we basically pay to like us and like us because without us they wouldn't exist? It would be worse than the insurgency in Iraq, it would be constant unending attacks from every actor in the region minus Israel and the Iraq Government Forces.\n\nWith Turkey then pissed at us and hating that group like they do? Even if they wouldn't attack the US they could just start harassing fire and attacks and keep the entire region unstable forever. And the US absolutely isn't going to war with Turkey over the SDF, as they already catch artillery fire and the US just shrugs, so the thought of the SDF withstanding a Turkish assault isn't worth wasting time on. \n\nTurkey has the largest military in the region and just because Erdogan has been acting fascist lately doesn't mean the US is going to risk relations with that powerful of an entity for the SDF. The SDF have heart but what else? Turkey has a full fledged, functional military and economy. The SDF would be a landlocked nation surrounded by enemies minus a route through Iraq because of the US forcing them to be friendly.\n\nOr maybe you mean moving Incirlik to Iraq or Eastern Europe. But that still doesn't change the geopolitical power of having Turkey as an ally compared to the SDF. A light militia measuring in the 10's of thousands just doesn't compare to the power of the Turkish military at all.""But why? The resulting fallout from Turkey turning against US geopolitical goals in the region outside of the SDF wouldn't be worth it. We would see them fully siding with Russia and leaving NATO.\n\nTurkeys military is used right now as a deterrent just by being in NATO. The threat of defense in the event of attack. Trading the 2nd largest NATO army for some light infantry militia is foolish on a strategic scale. The trade off isn't even comparable. Just because Turkey didn't risk their soldiers lives in Rojava doesn't mean they are bad guys. Just makes them pragmatic, the US is the world police not Turkey after all.\n\nTurkey already owns Idlib and Afrin, I don't think it would take to much more to get them to take it all, they already want to take Rojava too with only the US stopping them. The SDF will never threaten anyone in the region no matter how many toys we provide them, of which we haven't even given them the good stuff. They haven't even got ATGMs and crap like the FSA \"moderates\" got, the thought that the US would back them over Turkey is a fantasy. \n\nWe just let Turkey take Rojava and start backing them in Northern Syria as they remake Syria into their image. They are better liked in the region anyway and will go much further on the global stage as an ally than the SDF ever will.""&gt; What is this imaginary SDF nation that no one is asking for?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nOP said building a new Incirlik and supporting the SDF over Turkey. I just assumed he meant building inside SDF territory and if it gets a US base, it's basically SDF land just like Crimea is basically Russia. \n\nI do think Turkey goes to far in their hatred of the SDF for the connections with the PKK but ultimately I think relations with Turkey is worth more in the long run. We ally with the KSA and plenty of other shitty leaders for pragmatic reasons, don't see why Turkey has to be any different. \n\n""Because you want allies? Just because there isn't a world war today doesn't mean there never will be. \n\n&gt; Deterrent against who?\n\nDeterrent against anyone who attacks a NATO member and invokes NATO Article 5 of mutual defense.\n\nDFNS can surrender to Assad but that begs the question if the US doesn't just take a step to the left and let Turkey come in first if that was poised to happen. Syria isn't going to stop Turkey and neither is Russia with just the assets they have in the region. So who would the US rather have in Rojava? It's going to be the friendly asset every time, be it SDF or be it TAF and TFSA. \n\n&gt; Who does the SDF need to threaten?\n\nSDF needs to threaten the FSA elements who hate them, the Turks who hate them, the Syrian National Government who vows to retake their territory just around them right now off the top of my head. I think a smaller list would be who would be their allies without being forced into it or bought by the US.\n\nI don't morally agree with Turkey and their thoughts on the SDF but I find it more pragmatic to side with them in the event that either the SDF or Turkey escalates to the point we have to choose. I just hope it doesn't come to that.""I'd still rather have Turkey more in the Western sphere of influence than a Chinese, Russian, or any other group they may be a part of. They have their issues, just like we here in the US do, but that doesn't make the SDF a more valuable ally strategically. \n\n""&gt;  I don't care about NATO or the imaginary interest of the US\n\nThat's where we differ. I only care about the US interests so that's probably why we have some basic differences in this.""&gt; Who? Who is this hypothetical war going to be against?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nAnyone who attacks a NATO member, that's how mutual protection works. Could be Russia, could be India, could be Hydra, the point is you don't wait for war to break out to make allies and defense compacts. \n\n&gt; If Syria points their air defenses that way, they'll back off.\n\nThe S-300 isn't a force field and Turkey could penetrate it through over saturation alone. It's 3 battalions augmenting their old stuff. Sure it's going to stop Israel from randomly blasting Iran on the daily because it's not worth it for a prodding strike, but if Turkey wanted in Syria 3 battalions of S-300 isn't stopping that invasion.  \n\n&gt; offensively\n\nHaha yea, they won't be launching invasions any time soon.\n\n&gt; unstable dictatorships that cost a fortune to prop up\n\nIt already costs everyday to feed, clothe, protect, and provide an air force to the SDF. With Turkey we just let the locals handle things and immediately that's less of a fortune it's costing us. Providing support to a Turkish operation would be much cheaper than outfitting and supporting an SDF operation. \n\nTurkey doesn't have to live up to American Ideals, just be our ally when we need them, what they do on their own time is on them as long as they don't get ridiculous with things. ""I feel US interests (at least to me) is checking powers not friendly to our interests, Iran and Syria mainly here, internationally by any means needed. Keep the balance in our favor as much as possible.\n\nAfrin wasn't annihilated. There have been reports of shitty stuff going on but there was no genocide of people. No one was dragged into the streets for being Kurdish and shot. TFSA does some thug stuff and highway banditry but TAF keeps a heavy hand and punishes them when caught. It sucks but i don't fault them for using those militias rather than risking their own soldiers to further their agenda, it's no different than what the US does with the SDF or did with their FSA elements they were supplying so i can't be hypocritical. \n\nI won't argue that Afrin wasn't nicer before hand, it was, but in the event the US has to choose, sorry SDF.  \n\n""&gt;Both a lifesaving medic and a crack sniper, he was repeatedly decorated for valor and for coolheaded leadership during 19 years of combat deployments.
