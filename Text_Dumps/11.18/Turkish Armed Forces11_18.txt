"Turkey's main objective has always been crushing the KCK/PKK influence in the region.""I still don't get it why the situation escalated so quickly. ""First off Turkey is only targeting YPG, which although is a part of SDF, it does not represent the organisation as a whole. YPG is a part of KCK, a Communist-Kurdish organisation which carries out terrorist and separatist acts in Iran, Turkey, Iraq and Syria. YPG is directly supports PKK in Turkey. PKK is designated terrorist organisation which has carried out many suicide bombings in Turkey, leading to hundreds of civilian deaths. It should also be noted that YPG has persecuted Christian Assyrians in Syria.\n\nSecondly, Although I'm not a fan of Erdogan I must say that most of the blame for the rise of ISIS falls on the USA. You guys sent truckloads of weapons to them. You guys trained them. You caused the instability in Iraq which lead to their creation. Many leaks suggest that the USA had the biggest influence in the rise of ISIS. Your own allies, Saudi Arabia, radicalized Muslims all across the world and is fully responsible for the rise of Wahhabism. All Erdogan did was followed your orders by opening up the borders and his stupid son got cheap oil from northern Syria via both ISIS and other groups.\n\nMy third point is that your call to bomb Turkey is absurd, immature and frankly just sad. Turkey isn't just another Middle Eastern country. It has the capability to defend itself quite well so unless you're in for a long war then you won't gain anything. In a limited war Turkey could inflict some fairly noteworthy damage on the US air force and navy. Boots on the ground would fair even worse. It simply wouldn't be a war which America would want to get in. The geography, the people and the sheer amount of military hardware would make it a huge waste of energy, money and time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, your whole argument is flawed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;""&gt;Turkey is Secular.....  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There are many non-Muslims living freely in Turkey. ""\"**The American viewpoint as an American**\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou literally contradicted yourself by mentioning that you're a Kurd.. I don't understand why you guys keep lying about your nationality by posing as Russians, French, American's etc.  I've seen countless anti-Turkish troll accounts that were supposedly meant to be Americans yet after some examination turned out to be Kurdish. ""Turkey is a Secular country by law dude. ""&gt; I never called to bomb Turkey. \n\nWell actually you did.\n\n&gt;  We took down Iraq in 6 weeks with it being one of the largest army in the world.  We have nukes they don't. \n\nIraq had the 4th largest military back then, however their equipment was very outdated, they lacked proper training and they had a very unorganized military. Also Iraq's geography makes it horrible for a defensive war. Turkey on the other hand is a country which has an organised military with real training and fairly modern equipment. Its geography is suited for a defensive war and most of its population would back the military whether they're pro-gov or not (Turks, maybe not Kurds). Turkey has never been beaten ever since the Turkish war of independence and has a history of war obsession. Don't compare Turkey with Iraq.\n\n&gt; Why are you supporting historic European Imperalism? Thats the reason why the Kurds don't have a stats and these dictators use force against them. They use the conquer and divide strategy. They are just fighting for their freedom. \n\nExcuse me? Turkey is a country which was formed by fighting against imperialism. The Turks defeated France and Britain along with all their proxies and allies and carved out a nation of their own. Imperialists wanted to hand southeast Turkey to Armenians and Kurds, But Turks fought and won. So tell me who's supporting imperialism?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;""USA cant protect the whole border. There will always be somewhere to hit.

FSA considered backstabbing as there was no fight between FSA/YPG there.""I apologize if my English couldn't convey my thoughts clearly. I meant that an external aggressive interference to YPG/SDF controlled areas would debilitate them from employing \"preferred\" decisions on their fronts, or at least slow down the decision making process.\n\ntl;dr it's not broken, but it's hurt from interference""As a Turk I feel ashamed USA soldiers training Turkish soldiers like that as if they don\u2019t know how to shoot.

You're right in the end, usually I am realistic but sometimes I get 'why?' on simple tasks.""&gt; i don't think there is anyone naive enough to believe( even if they  wanted to) that the Turkish military executes civilians and kids \n\nOh, but there are. 2 years ago, during the urban warfare to oust PKK militants from town centers, there were even videos posted of South American paramilitaries that were beating up kids, presenting them as Turkish soldiers and there were tons of people buying into that in the comments. Never underestimate how willing most people are to believe very apparent lies that suits their own bias. This \"Turkish snipers targeting civilians\" narrative was being played back then by PKK as well, many foreign publications bought into that.""Every civilian casualty is an upsetting tragedy, yet unfortunately, as long as explosives are the limit of current military tech, collateral damage is oftentimes unavoidable, especially with artillery rounds. That's why the targets relayed to artillery crews should be carefully picked. But even then, I guess zero casualties are pretty much impossible if military targets aren't far from civilians. Shrapnel pieces can go a long way.\n\nMay she rest in peace and my sympathies to her family.""Even here, previous post has ~500 upvotes, and over 200 comments. I can't even imagine the news/comments circulating on Facebook.""Maybe you can add flair to the post. As huxtiblejones said, damage is done, people moved on already.""While I haven't seen that footage, so hypothetically speaking, captured militants and civilians are drastically different entities. While still a very wrong thing to do, captured prisoners can be perceived as 'guilty of killing comrades' in occasions and be retaliated on where a sane commanding officer isn't present, even in modern times. Civilians would be viewed as innocent by that mindset. So it's a massive leap really.\n\nUS troops were caught killing Afghan civilians, that doesn't mean US military is on a campaign to kill civilians. It's mostly about command supervision missing particular events like that or complicit lower ranked officers.""You should do it with proper permissions (journalist/student etc.) from Turkish government. You can easily get arrested and charged with espionage with your tourist visa if you start asking people about YPG/SCW.""There wouldn't be in the short term. Just a couple of howitzer fires as usual for years. TAF hasn't piled Leo 2A4, M60T, commandos, FSA members near the border of Tal Abyad or Kobane. The reason why this has been talked a lot is YPG has problems around the Baghuz area for a couple of weeks and they fear a possible Turkish attack. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore the Afrin operation, there had been weeks of military shiptment to the border, FSA was gathering around the Afrin. You can't do an operation just with 155howitzers. YPG uses it to put pressure on Turkey and blaming the failure in the southern front on Turkey.""You can always be part of humanitarian organization If you want to learn more about SCW and refugee. It is the only way If you ask me. http://www.unhcr.org/turkey.html https://www.afad.gov.tr/en/2634/AFAD-Contact-List\n\nOtherwise your tourist visa and statement won't save you once you got arrested for suspicious behavior etc... I wouldn't risk it.\n\nedit: To be clear; You are free to visit any city and be part of any cultural events with your tourist visa.""You are stretching the events to meet your wish.""IS has returned to its pre-state era where they started funding themselves and started to group up. I always said they went underground, will be back in time.""For Japanese the society takes precedence over the individual. Government trying to rescue him has negative consequences for the country and by extension society. It was his own choice to be in that risky position, he wasn\u2019t under duty by the government after all. Very different culture and mindset, I\u2019m not saying right or wrong but very unique.\n\nConsidering that another dead journalist\u2019s mother had issued a similar apology, this does not surprise me.""Sandstroms = no US air support...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe SDF aren't that much better than FSA, so without air support they are pretty much useless. It must be mentioned that ISIS are the most well motivated force in Syria despite losing so much territory. They fight ruthlessly with or without the use of captagon. On the other hand SDF heavily rely on US support. The US bombs a town to oblivion and the SDF head in and clean up what's left. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA good example of this is Raqqa.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso if we have a look at FSA, they were absolutely pathetic until Turkey stepped in. Even with barely any airstrikes they defeated ISIS in Al-Bab and demolished the 'unbeatable' Afrin YPG within 2 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusion SDF and FSA are nothing without US or Turkish backing. ""You claimed \"they\" (whomever they are you claim) are more reliable which was an ignorant claim which I debunked, basic historical facts are enough for that. Turkey had no interest except \"being a reliable partner\" sending soldiers to Korea, Afghanistan, Somalia, Bosnia etc the list goes on. While your \"they\" had done no such thing, so just admit you overreached.""Causes from ye olde times, blacks in the USA had much less rights than Kurds in Turkey had, I'm not aware of them taking up arms and continuing to do that after most of their grievances are settled. Would you like some people saying \"we're now bombing everywhere in France because burqa is banned\"? Or would you prefer them to resort to civil protest?\n\nMore ignorance coming from your part: PKK kicked them out of their homes to use their homes as battlements, even used a different abbreviation for that and dumped that abbreviation to save their PR value. Kurds were asking for the police to kick them out which were under Erdogan's orders to not interfere because of the so-called 'peace process'. The crushing majority of those 'non-combatants' either aided or abetted to such gangs, using municipality work machines to dig trenches and plant IEDs under roads.\n\nYeah, like Afghanistan's mujaheddin in 80s, that looked like a long-term plan too. Oh boy, I'm looking forward to the day that KCK communists drop capitalist westerners and house Chinese or Russian bases. Once again you'll turn to Turkey against them then.\n\nYour proof would be found with a simple research that doesn't involve sources with the agenda of white-washing KCK and its branches. So far all your view on the matter seems to stem from those based on what you're writing.""Ypg cannot hold far south syria in their hands for long. Their ideologies(marksist-far left) are just opposite with the locals there. Also locals prefer saa over sdf any day. There is already heavy insurgency in going on,its only matter of time major uprising happens.""An hour ago there was reports there are helicopters flying over Rasalayn. There is always somewhere to hit for Turkey. US and SDF did the same a year ago for Tal Abyad and Kobane. SDF even raised USA flag to stop Turkey from shelling. A year passed and same things are happening again. These shellings and patrols will get attention from time to time.""Yeah this is getting emberassing.I wonder what would happened if world strongest airforces didnt actually support them.  ""Intelligence must be like ''Can't shell anymore? Say no more. Bring the Qiyam squad''""You may say it for FSA members but not for Qiyam members. These guys are not doing simple tasks, they do some next level assasinations which led some of its members to death. Money will come later than many things for this squad. They haven't been working becaused they were arrested or died during the assasination attempts. They needed time to resurrect""Yep, you made some good points. The part about the SDF trying to maintain US presence is particularly interesting. However it must be said that the US wants to stay in northern Syria for a long time. So maybe it wants to keep a small ISIS force alive so it has an excuse to stay there.  ""Well yeah. They did have a lot of 'elites' there as well as a fuckton of equipment. \n\nOn that note there might be another reason for there slowness.. the loss at Afrin may have greatly affected their motivation and morale.""&gt; *Are there any reports on the size of the deployment and what equipment is arriving?* \n\nI'm assuming dozens of upgraded m60s along with assorted APCs""KSA intelligence has long been trying to contact with Tribal leaders to cooperate with the SDF, seems like not working very well as expected. YPG made many enemies during the Syrian Civil War, years will pas but the anger inside the tribes will stay. Assad and Turkey will use it very well.""Yeah,if isis held afrin it would be much much harder to capture these areas. Afrin is like natural fortress surrounded by mountains. Ypg failed miserably there.""1200 man is more than enough for capturing tal abyad town itself,nearly every major town ypg controls(except for haseke,raqqa and  tabqa) are just near turkish border. You cannot defend these locations,they are naturally surrounded by turkish border and probably gets surrounded from every direction in the first week of operations.  \n\n\nOfcourse you are right about the countryside of these towns,you will need much more than that,but as i say operation can be started with minimal numbers too.""&gt;Unless the offensive managed to overwhelm the soldiers at the border and immediately shove them out of the town\n\nThis is the reason,just like isis retreated from jarablus(also border town) because it was the entry point of overwhelming number of soldiers with fsa members,tanks,armored vehicles attack helicopters etc. 1200 fsa will be enough because turkey will use its own overwhelming force with it too. Also tal abyad is considerably small town,ypg cannot pour in more than enough men there or they will be picked up very easily with air strikes. Unless they want to lose hundreds of manpower they wouldn even try to defend the town. They should focus more on diplomacy aka. american protection.""Author is aaron stein btw,one of the guys likes to bash on turkey daily basis. ""I wonder if it was qiyam,isis claim is far fetch.""Last week they also appointed one of the most wanted pkk member and mastermind of attacking and killing 104 turkish soldiers through his life in pkk \"azad simi\"(code named \"\u00e7iya kobani\") to the head of ypg's hybrid operations. There is that.""I never claimed I was objective, I belong to a side after all that didn't start the fight yet are under attack. Turkey has made mistakes and there are things to improve, yet none of them warrant armed terrorism. Would you be okay getting bombed dining in a restaurant because of stuff Netherlands did in the past?\n\nWhat Black Panthers did wouldn't amount to a thousandth of what PKK did. Not \"are denying\", \"used to\". Like Netherlands used to do awful stuff in Asia.\n\nAnd there are. Self-defense to what? PKK won't disband if Erdogan is gone tomorrow and some prisoners are released. You once again demonstrate that you have little understanding about the issue altogether. PKK and its affiliates are set on dividing Turkey, it's their end goal. Turks will never let that happen. Very clear cut issue that predates Erdogan and which will probably outlive him like it did his predecessors.\n\nBeing ignorant isn't something to be ashamed, but staying ignorant is. I'm ignorant about East Timor for example, so I wouldn't claim I know better than an Indonesian. If I wanted to, I'd first educate myself thoroughly about it. Which is what you should have done in this matter.\n\nGovernments and government-guided media shaping opinions of masses. Like how YPG are \"the good guys\" now, they could press a button and their name would be dragged through the dirt, there's enough material for that, just needs presenting through news networks for a week or two.\n\nMany share your thoughts about Erdogan here, most use TAF flair instead of Turkey flair due to that reason. We don't support the government under him but the military which defends the country and fights its enemies no matter who is in charge.\n\nI support every government and military which fights to save the integrity of its domains against terrorism, blindly. If there are social rights grievances, those aren't supposed to be solved with guns and violence. Unless you can renounce terrorism as a viable method, there can be no understanding between us.""They probably think it will be shot down any way.""You see what you want to see. He says \"armenians are proud of you\" and is obviously referring to the insurgents and doesn't even use the word \"kurds\". Hunting down civilians part is just your imagination at work.""Seriously?

Who do you think killed them and wounded as many if not more than that?""&gt;Genocide can happen not only through the physical annihilation of a  people, but through other acts like forced assimilation as well \n\nThis line takes the award of the biggest non-sense I have ever seen in this sub. Stop making up imaginary descriptions to an established word to force your biased narrative. Due to people like you, Erdogan and other sensationalists that cannot make criticism without throwing around big words, it's cheapening the word genocide, it's losing the gravitas it used to carry.\n\nMoreover, currently there's no forced assimilation of Kurds in Turkey. History does repeat itself though, imperialists of your kind once again is trying to divide up Turkey by using minorities.""Does SDF release their casualties?""Then either you have not met current PKK cadre or they were just not being honest with you. PKK could and can always give up guns and transition to politics, are you aware that there are already MPs in the parliament who are from Ocalan\u2019s family? There is no prevention of participating in politics and advocating about their cause if social rights really is the matter.\n\nTurks won\u2019t give up any more land, we are fine with everyone having their civil rights and expressing themselves as long as they are not mouthpieces of bombers, kidnappers and murderers. Don\u2019t expect what you wouldn\u2019t expect in your own country.\n\nWhile I detest Erdogan, his achievements for Kurdish rights exceed any Kurdish or Turkish politician in Turkey. He wants to stay in power so he ramps up nationalistic rhetoric like Trump does. Kurds still have the same rights they were granted before.\n\nPKK broke the ceasefire, PKK used the ceasefire as a means to infect towns with armed gangs. They were the aggressor, now and always. YPG\u2019s Salih Muslim used to visit Ankara back then, Turkey tried to deal with YPG peacefully. YPG took PKK\u2019s side instead and since conflict renewed, YPG also is a major threat to Turkey now.\n\nThe biggest urban warfare happened in towns closest to YPG borders with Turkey, like Cizre just across Jizira canton, tunnels extending from town centers to bring in fighters and arms. You might be naive enough to think of that as coincidence, I\u2019m not. Like how gang wars in southern USA are directly linked to Mexican cartels. YPG has to sever ties with PKK to avoid conflict.""Thanks. Only source I could find is Syrian HR, which I have little faith in them.

It is just western PR that alters the perception like it is done today in Syria.""PKK does not exist to defend anything, their raison d\u2019etre is aggression against Turkey to carve lands for themselves. Kurds in Turkey aren\u2019t under attack by Turks, Turkish security forces are tasked as any other sovereign body\u2019s apparatus to fight against armed aggression. PKK attack civilians and own those or have rebranded departments to own some of those. Ultimately they all originate from the same letter soup and are governed by it. Collapse of the peace process also is result of an attack explicitly owned by PKK.\n\nAnybody who supports PKK is no less misguided than ISIS supporters, both conjure up self-righteous reasons to wage war and use any means necessary to further their goals.

Just do some basic research on it.""There are, western news typically omit many such attacks because Turkey is on the \u201chere be dragons\u201d part of the world in the western psyche. Unless the the event is particularly bloody, you will not see any mention of it. VBIEDs are especially seeing widespread use after KCK experienced their effect from ISIS. Their training with PLO means that no method is too vile to employ for their goals. Ignoring that simple fact would be naivety as PKK bombs, suicide bombs, kidnaps, kills kidnapped people, kill people, ambush, use IEDs, VBIEDs, execute in public, execute in house, ambush, target families of security forces, target public gathering places and so on.\n\nMy info is living in Turkey since before PKK existed, their attacks are documented and owned.

Western agendas to ruin Middle East is the biggest threat to that goal and people buying into propaganda that Middle Eastern countries should be divided into tiny pieces so Israel can dominate the region isn't helping.""That sounds as preposterous as saying \"AQ flew those planes because USA was oppressing Muslims\".\n\nPKK started it because it was tasked by the Soviets to weaken and if possible, (as ASALA faded, pretty curious how these groups pass on batons) divide the NATO country that formed the vanguard against Caucasus. Fast forward, it's still being used by different powers because why not infect a country that can throw a wrench into outside machinations over Middle East if left unchecked?""Rare? A few years ago? Uh, no. I'm regularly browsing through western media and if they have a word about YPG, it's ALWAYS good. I have so far not seen any negative or even unbiased coverage. Compare that to Erdogan whose name is counted among the boogeymen of the western world that are Putin, Maduro, Duterte and the like. And Turkey is presented as 'Erdogan' all the time, as if it's his own personal fight against PKK and its affiliates and it's a made up fight, reporters always act baffled when saying \"Turkey considers YPG a terror group\". Never once the ties are mentioned, even when admitted by US officials in the highest offices.""It's \"changing the demographics\" when Syrian refugees are sent to Afrin because they want Arabs to settle in Turkey so they can create unchallenged Kurdish hegemony in Northern and Eastern Syria where they used to be minority. If Arabs come back to Syria, Kurds will again be outnumbered greatly as they were used to.\n\nNow think yourself who are the ones being racist, trying to grab a third of a country with a tenth of the population.""Conveniently, yet blatantly ignoring the glaring quote, instead trying to misdirect and deflect from the particular topic at hand that is the connection of PKK and YPG. Might I remind you that we can still see that you haven't addressed that?""&gt; The Kurdish-majority northeast border is possibly the most liberal area in all of Syria,\n\nyeah you can't be more detached from reality from that. Kurdish areas just across the border in Urfa and Mardin are among the most conservative in Turkey. I have many friends over there, i don't think it's much different just at the other side. \n\nEnough of this sub for me""It's up to Syrians, be it Arab, Kurdish or else to discuss and decide how to govern their lands, I won't comment on who gets what. The only part of your power struggles that concerns us is how you want millions of refugees to be settled in Turkey so YPG can have its pie and eat it in the areas they took over where Arabs fled from. It isn't Turkey's problem if the refugees are settled in Damascus, Afrin or Deir ez Zor. They're going wherever they can. Maybe YPG should have offered to take them in back where they used to live instead but I never heard such a proposition so far. Explains the actual goal behind \"Turkey is population engineering\" propaganda.""Freedom fighter force? Come on, RL isn't anything like Saturday morning cartoons. Soviets aided them because they want to weaken NATO, Putin became best buddies with Erdogan because of the same reason, follow the trail. You seem to be ignoring even the very apparent power play structures in the region.""There are many and there are also many shows on TV. Not few at all. All the coverage is pro-YPG, none of the coverage is pro-Turkey. You seem to be deliberately ignoring all those countless reports and opinion pieces, all supported by unanimous anti-Turkish hatred in comment sections of those articles. Guardian is notoriously anti-Turkey. Just check \"Turkey\" tag on their site and see how it goes. What's speaking Kurdish got anything to do with a reporter? I already told you it's a western agenda, who speaks has no meaning whatsoever when the goal is propping up YPG in the public eye.\n\nIt's hilarious that even after a one-sided media crusade of a few years, you can still claim that YPG is the underdog in media. YPG follows Israel in \"the guys our audience has to support in ME\" agenda in western media and woe to any dissenter, they will be hounded by dozens of trolls in comments and learn their lesson.""Eh, either we're not reading the same Guardian or you just ignore 95% of their articles.\n\nNetanyahu's open support for Kurdish ambitions are no secret, he'd side with Martians if it meant it'd weaken everyone else in the region. But my statement was how western agendas were about supporting Israel and YPG at all costs. Different matters.\n\nI'm not reduced to, I point out to another aspect of the issue. You talked about self-pity in another post, I'd say it applies to you more than anyone else here with your claims. I'm tired of this \"play the victim yet refuse the victim portrayals because it compromises my victimhood claim\" charade really. I'm finished with this discussion.""I don't claim that Kurds never had any grievances towards Turkish state. I'll openly admit that the coup in '80 resulted in some of the issues that are being propagated as 'reasons' of PKK. Yet since you also have a first-hand experience in such problems in India, would you say everything that happens in India is solely due to what happens in India, or are there other actors and factors involved?\n\nThere are many ethnic and religious fault lines and grievances across the world, yet the primary reason you're not seeing armed insurrections here and there is because another player aren't fanning the flames or they're not powerful enough to do it. If Turkey was as powerful as, let's say China or USA, PKK would vaporize in a month tops.\n\nIt never is as simple as \"William Wallace took a sword and rose up\" in modern times. Delve deeper and you'll always find somebody muddying the waters.""It's not confusing. Everybody in this sub-reddit is aware the main reason USA is risking relations with Turkey to support YPG entrenchment in Syria is countering Iran. Who has the most beef with Iran? Netanyahu. Who's doing everything he can to appease Netanyahu? Trump. It's not rocket science really. Netanyahu's current agenda is trying to get USA and Iran in a hot war and YPG is paramount for that.\n\nIt's nothing alike, get a grip on reality please. Turkey isn't protected by a throng of organizations that cry \"anti-Turkish racists\" and ruin careers of anyone that dare speak against Netanyahu's politics.\n\nTurkey and Israel is nothing alike in any way you proposed. I have nothing against the state of Israel but the situation in Gaza and West Bank couldn't be further than the situation in Turkey.""I totally agree on that, this whole mess is mostly a failed experimentation of AKP. Turkey should never had involved itself with SCW like this back then. I can say it's the biggest foreign policy blunder of a century for Turkey. I'd prefer Assad over some pseudo-Ocalan every day of the week and twice on Sundays, a sentiment that many Turks share I believe.""Israel's own publication and narrative is a whole another different mechanism then pro-Israel media of the west, while both server the same agenda. Turkey doesn't enjoy a machination in the west like that so nothing alike altogether.\n\nA Turk accusing you of racism would have zero effect whatsoever, as you said, it would fall on deaf ears. Blaming someone with Anti-Turkism has not even 0.000000001% weight of blaming someone with Anti-Semitism. You can a be a proud Anti-Turk and get even support for it. Yet if you're labeled as an Anti-Semite, your career and social life would be pretty much over. Don't even claim the connotations are ANYWHERE close.\n\nNetanyahu doesn't even need to directly involve himself with YPG, he has a middleman for all that. Jeez, is it that hard to link the dots? YPG is a thorn in Assad's side, even without Iran involved in the picture.""First of all, Turkey has or had good relations with KRG, until their independence attempt. I'd say the official Turkish government position would be \"it's their own issue unless an independence movement triggers a region-wide cascading effect\" in such a situation.\n\nHowever, as for YPG, as shown in this thread aptly, they view Ocalan as their leader and keep close, organic ties with PKK, staying under KCK umbrella. They would have to shed all of that and not just visually but wholeheartedly, and demonstrate that to persuade Turkey. I might then, personally believe them (not gonna buy it myself if one day they hail PKK for Kurdish freedom movement, then next day take down Ocalan posters) but I don't know about Turkish government.""YPG and PKK ties ceasing to exist would be paramount in any case, I don\u2019t think Turkey would object to any entity merely because of ethnicity. It is about who they are affiliated to. I believe that Turkey already tried that approach when Salih Muslim visited Ankara several years ago. There was a chance to get along with YPG.""Fair enough, but it cannot be stopped via just giving them everything they want. That is a slippery slope.\n\nThere is great progress when it comes to social and civil rights but their latest demands at the outset of renewed hostilities were full autonomy barring their own military which cannot be done.\n\nPKK was mostly subdued throughout 2000s, only after SCW and the resurgence of YPG that they found new power, not a coincidence obviously.\n\nManiacal_monster gives some examples about the reforms in another post here that you can check out.""I doubt the driver was killed in that attack, IED exploded after the car passed through it a bit. They also didn't show the corpse. When I compare this video with the others, this is less convincing and a bit 'meh'.""That tv chanel is not Turkish btw.""Qiyam is an Arab group supported by Turkey targetting YPG and there are many Arabs in Syria hates YPG for a long time. So its not very hard for Intelligence services to find someone like Qiyam members. People should give up thinking about 'The ones attacking YPG is clearly ISIS' there are many groups countries hate YPG.""Until westerners like you care about Turkish deaths, you will not see news of them in western papers. It\u2019s a catch 22.""Steven Cook: US should get everything, turkey should get nothing that they want. If else; US good, turkey bad. I have yet to see a different template from him. ""We saw how that peace process worked. Thousands of security personel and civilians dead. Pkk used the peace to store ammunition and train militants. Pkk cannot be trusted.

We want to secure our borders""I don't know where you are getting your news from but nobody has bombs dropping on them in diyarbak\u0131r. We are bombing terrorist shelters in northern iraq. Rarely we bomb mountains of hakkari and \u015f\u0131rnak. There are no civilians there. Kurds in Turkey have the same rights a Turkish person has. This is not the 80s oppressive Turkey anymore. \n\nPkk terrorists can't stay in Turkey for long after they carry out an attack. They used to flee back to northern iraq and sdf controlled syrian areas. Since there are Turkish troops in northern iraq and afrin 2 of their safe havens are no longer safe for them. Their routes which they use to smuggle militants from northern iraq and syria are cut off. This is the reason there were fewer terrorist attacks after we started cross border operations. ""The YPG didn't came with a election. They came with force and ejected by force. ""YPG is the sister of PKK which Turkey fights for decades. ""Very much security it has brought.""Exactly the same rights. A Turkish man has the same chance of getting arrested for coup ties as a kurdish man. Turkey has its problems but those problems affect everyone not just kurds. \n\nAs for the dialogue I would support the diaoogue if pkk completely disarms and members surrender. Erdogan tried to negotiate with pkk even though many protested and in the result pkk used the peace process to store arms and riddle cities with ieds. Any deal made with politicans will look like a gain of pkk and raise their support. Before pkk surrenders I see no negotiations ahead of us.""Which country in the worlld has designated the FSA or any of the rebel groups in TFSA as  terrorists? ""Kurdish isn't synonimous with YPG, bor their ideology is. ""They look like any other 'badass military/police' from Hollywood movie posters, how do you gauge goodness from a pose?

If that is your logic, then FSA invited Turkey to Syria.""Police spec ops were trained in urban warfare and equipped for that, operated against PKK insurrections inside Turkey. Thousands of people were recruited into police spec ops during 2015-2016 due to the need to clear towns of PKK presence. They were working in unison with military commandos. Not much different that what happened in USA a couple of years ago, police looking like paramilitaries since Obama gave Iraqi surplus gear to them. That kind of personnel isn't available widely, it makes sense that they were utilized abroad as well, since the opposition isn't a country but a militia.\n\nIt's pretty much semantics at this point but a conscript sitting in a garrison back in Istanbul couldn't perform like these guys. Ultimately all countries have to reform specific branches even if a temporary measure. If PKK ceased to exist tomorrow, they would be disbanded gradually over time.""No, your examples should have been like this:\n\n\"These hero British are just here in Belgium for the security of Belgians.\"\n\n\"These hero Americans are just in Korea for the security of Koreans.\"\n\n\"These hero French are just in Mali for the security of Malians.\"\n\nMy point is that you selectively picked the examples that history has acknowledged to be 'the bad guys', what I have done is switching them to western world-acknowledged 'good guys'. Now this comparison hold merit since it's no longer black/white but shades of gray.""While I have no love lost for MHP or Grey Wolves, since police spec ops is something people have to voluntarily enroll into, only people of a certain mindset will be willing to join that, since job description was literally clearing PKK door to door in towns 2 years ago. I don't know anyone personally who would even consider doing that kind of job for any kind of money, so I appreciate them doing it even though I wouldn't agree with them on most other issues.\n\nMost police officers in USA vote Republican even though that job doesn't involve fighting urban warfare against military-grade equipped militants. You need a certain kind of world view and many people don't care about protecting or serving.""There are like a dozen new \"TURKISH-BACKED GUYS HAVE DONE A BAD THING!\" thread per day, you can go check them out if that's what you'd like to see instead.""&gt;The US and other Western countries have always recognized the PYD as an affiliate of the PKK.\n\nThey were denying the connection before at official level as stated in the article;\n\n\"He also said that the Kurdish groups in Rojava, northern Syria are \u201can  offshoot\u201d of the PKK, the first time a member of the Trump  administration has publicly stated as such, but gave no indication that  would affect US support for them.\"""Ah, right. Like how the Soviets were invited to Afghanistan, being invited is enough I guess, and they go to save the locals every time of course, never to further their own agenda or secure their own interest.""Americans fly their flag too, why wouldn't any military force use their own flag? If the local government cannot hold onto his lands and prevent attacks from there, of course whomever is affected can intervene. Afghanistan, Somalia, etc countless examples.\n\nIf Mexico lost the control of its border provinces to gangs and cartels attacked USA from Mexico border, US military would move in and crush them while flying their own flag. It would only be normal.""Okay, let's get real: Turkey got in Syria to defend itself and only itself, not for \"freedom\" or anything like that. USA got in to take hold of ISIS' lands and mess up Syria and Iran's plans, not to defend YPG from ISIS or anything. That's a hilarious proposition really, as if USA rushed in to save people. I'm not holding that against them either, no government on this Earth spends that much money and risk lives without having a direct benefit.\n\nUSA supports pseudo-commies as muscle, Turkey uses jihadis as muscle. It's not like Syria has tons of modern, feminist, vegan, liberal capitalists that wanna fight, you know. US used jihadis when it couldn't find anyone else before as well, not like their record is any better. Everybody makes do with what they have available. US takes over land from its enemies, Turkey takes over land from its enemies. It just happens that US muscle happens to be Turkey's enemy in this case.

Nothing. It'd have to be returned to Assad eventually. In exchange for a tap on the back from the west? No thanks.\n\nSecond of all, the legal framework for it wasn't existent since ISIS had not attacked Turkey yet. Moreover, PKK/YPG/HDP **DID NOT** want Turkey to go in. I still remember a HDP MP on TV explicitly saying \"they don't want Turks in there, don't intervene\" and this comes from the party that represents about half the Kurds in Turkey. What was wanted is letting PKK and YPG militants fall back, transit and supply from Turkey as much as they wanted, acting like a \"guard zone\". YPG would still keep all the lands and Turkey would again keep a pat on the back this way. Or, YPG would again be in conflict in Turkey because of moving in to their region of interest.\n\nHindsight is 20/20, the only mistake Turkey did was weakening Assad by supporting FSA. ISIS and YPG are the eggs from that chicken. It's the biggest blunder of modern Turkish history.""First, it does not work but it is not as much a threat either the state or the Turkish people\u2019s lives, (just do a basic fact check to see total casualties by either threat) and the whole world was already fighting them so their demise was both soon and inevitable.\n\nWhile for 99% of the world snow isn\u2019t a lethal threat, it is for those who live near sites with avalanche risks and that is a priority for them, although global warming might not be as a big a threat to them as the rest of the world.

They antagonized and tried to fight everyone at their peak, but they still were fighting an already embattled Assad and a fragmented Syria. Even the worst case scenario would be direct Turkish and Iranian intervention, still would be costly battles for those two but ISIS would still collapse. No way it could live unless you propose Saudis and Gulf would feed them and Israel would tolerate them, in which case USA is their enabler so not much we can do there as we all see.

The most logical outcome happened as we witnessed, the mob torched Frankenstein's monster.""this is some sick shit""Or they could just drop arms, change clothes and flee or disappear into the population.

Sticks and stones and all that. The critique should be leveled to Iraqi army which fled without evacuating foreign personnel if somebody really wants to criticize.""Eh, straw-manning there with an unaware of the apparent nuances conclusion: I said \"not a long-term serious threat\", it was a short-term medium threat, below the YPG which was a long-term serious threat. Once again, established by the facts, not fantasy.\n\nMoreover, ISIS and Erdogan couldn't be farther away: ISIS are Nazis with an Islamic guise, while Erdogan is a Machiavellist with a penchant for the good life which is totally at odds with ISIS lifestyle.

A popular answer, as mentioned above and favored by the YPG as well as its proponents, boils down to \u201cReductio ad Erdoganum\u201d: because Erdogan hates the Kurds. In reality, Turkey\u2019s concern for the YPG derives from three factors. The first is the most obvious one: Regardless of branding, the YPG at a minimum has organic ties with the PKK. A more balanced interpretation would portray the YPG as an offshoot of the PKK, **with the latter\u2019s cadres exerting overwhelming influence over YPG**.\n&gt;In the longer term, the YPG\u2019s increasing popularity and leverage can trigger a process that will **\u201cwhitewash\u201d the PKK**.\n\nhttps://warontherocks.com/2017/08/making-sense-of-turkeys-syria-strategy-a-turkish-tragedy-in-the-making/\n\n(this is an opinion piece of Burak Kadercan an Assistant Professor of Strategy and Policy at the United States Naval War College. He has definitely credibility.)\n\n&gt;Despite the PKK\u2019s terrorist designation, the organization has played an instrumental role in both the Syrian Civil War and the  fight against ISIL. The PKK\u2019s longstanding transnational presence in both Iraq and Syria has ensured that they are deeply involved in both theatres of conflict.\n\u2022 Multiple credible sources indicate that the **PKK is the driving force behind the Syrian Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) and the YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).**\n\n&gt;&gt; There is no coincidence that the PYD controlled areas in the north and east of Syria largely manifests O\u0308calan\u2019s vision of a de facto state that strives to decentralize all social, political, and economic affairs in local councils.23 Their relationship ensures that the PYD\u2019s YPG armed forces, and the YPG dominated SDF, are principally guided by PKK priorities. One PKK fighter in Sinjar province, who was interviewed\nby the Wall Street Journal in July 2015, illustrated the fluidity of these organizations by saying, \u201cSometimes I\u2019m a PKK, sometimes I\u2019m a PJAK [a PKK affiliate, active in Iran], sometimes I\u2019m a YPG. It doesn\u2019t really matter. They are all members of the PKK.\u201d24 **As Bill Park, of the Department of Defence Studies at King\u2019s College London, explained, \u201cthe Syrian Kurds, PKK, PYD, whatever you want to call them\u201d are one and the same.**\n\n[Source](http://icsr.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ICSR-Report-War-of-Shadows-How-Turkeys-Conflict-with-the-PKK-Shapes-the-Syrian-Civil-War-and-Iraqi-Kurdistan.pdf)\n\n&gt;We literally played back to them: \u2018You have got to change your brand. What do you want to call yourselves besides the YPG?\u2019 With about a day\u2019s notice they declared that they are the Syrian Democratic Forces.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cI thought it was a stroke of brilliance to put democracy in there somewhere. But it gave them a little bit of credibility.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-usa-ypg/u-s-general-told-syrias-ypg-you-have-got-to-change-your-brand-idUSKBN1A62SS?il=0\n\nPlease spare with us to try to whitewash the PKK affiliates\n""More like only reason.(Safety of israel,countering iranians etc)""First of all the americans had never complete control of Vietnam. Second, how many KIA's does the TAF have in Afrin of all these ongoing insurgency? 0. YPG shows its wannabe Vietcong-like effectiveness.\n\n""I know \u0130rfan Sapmaz (journalist) covered the Afrin operation within TFSA. He has hours of video published on Youtube. You can message him about your project. His channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG8jWMXDVdjT6n3UMC10yvA/videos""I wonder if they would fire that missile if they had paid for it instead of getting free. Such a waste of atgm.""\u0131 can't find this on Turkish sources, is there any other source reporting this?""I fully agree sad that people downvote you because they don\u2018t like the reality\n\nErdogan is the best the Kurds ever had he was called traitor by all opposition except HDP for obvious reasons. \nHe defended PKK saying they weren\u2018t terrorist. Calling \u00d6calan with \u201aSayin\u2018. Attacking anyone who questioned the peace process.\n\nPKK/YPG Kurds forgot this very fast because their current Agenda is to inject their Propaganda into the (rightful) existing negative coverage in western mainstream media of Erdogan.\n\nEverything anti Pkk was Pro Erdogan and for some it is still today.\n\nBeing anti Erdogan was automatically pro kurdish somehow. I laughed and cringed very often to these comments but sometimes when I see western people try to inform themselves they don\u2018t understand the brighter context and the Propaganda behind all these TwitterKurds account etc""What does this have to do with being pro Erdogan??""I in fact was talking of Kurds in General in Turkey.\nYou need to know that Kurds were forbidden to speak kurdish in public, celebrate kurdish festivals like their new years eve 'Newroz', their script was forbidden because it was not \"compatible\" with turkish language script (missing letters like W, Q etc.), showing the Kurdistan flag was forbidden as well. i don't know your background but you seem to misinterpret what I wrote. Why else has Erdogan so many kurdish votes? He is the one who lifted all these bans . Kurds are mostly conservative and religious they do like Erdogan very much. These are facts. Stating that i have a history of violations because of this makes no sense. i had one warning and you imply that i do it constantly as if I was some troll or something. I demand justice""Thank you for being reasonable."
