That could provoke Russia - and Turkey. Their army wants to bombard more Kurds positions.\n\n&gt; While Russia, France, Turkey and Germany are negotiating Syria's future with a remaining President Bashar al Assad, it has become known that the Federal Government supports the opposition with millions. According to Tagesspiegel information, the rebels surrounded in Idlib, Syria's most important stronghold of the insurgents, currently receive 37.5 million euros from the Federal Foreign Office and the Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) from the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. In addition come 11.3 million euros from other donors and co-managed by German authorities 17.05 million euros of the European Union. In total, this means almost 49 million euros.\n\n&gt; This is the result of a response from State Secretary Walter Lindner (SPD) at the request of the Bundestag deputy Evrim Sommer (Left), which is the Tagesspiegel present. This help is explosive in that it could provoke at least two governments. First, there is Russia, which supports the central government of Assad. He wants to conquer the rebel stronghold and is held by the international community - especially his ally Moscow - so far prevented. Then there is the Turkish government, which upgraded Islamist and Turkmen militias in Idlib.\nFederal Government: Helping civilian actors, not extremist rebels\n\n\n&gt; The Ankara ruling AKP government wanted to topple Assad for years. However, it is now using its forces as a priority to attack pro-Western and socialist Kurds in Syria. The funds of the German Federal Government for rebels in Idlib are likely to annoy Ankara, if Secretary of State Lindner should be right. Support locally \"civilian actors opposing extremist influences in the Idlib region,\" he writes in response to the request. Which means that the pro-Turkish Islamists are probably exempt.\nAlso on Tuesday, it was announced that Assad's government again accused Turkey of failing to implement Moscow's disarmament of Islamists in Idlib. The government in Ankara is unwilling to abide by the agreements, said Foreign Minister Walid al Mualem in Damascus the state news agency Sana. Ankara disagreed: The creation of a demilitarized zone agreed with Russia is proceeding according to plan. If extremists prevent the withdrawal, attack the Turkish army. At the Syrian summit in Ankara a few days ago, Russia's head of state Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed their agreement.\nErdogan announces bombs also east of the Euphrates\n\n&gt; Erdogan uses this situation for Turkish expansion claims. Ankara's army currently occupies northern Syrian-Kurdish areas and is rebuilding the infrastructure there. Erdogan's aim is to prevent a Kurdish autonomy zone as in northern Iraq. So Erdogan announced on Tuesday the beginning of a new offensive. Apparently, he now wants to attack the Kurds, Christians and secular Arab associations supported by the United States, even where US troops are helping them. The operation against \"terrorist structures\" east of the Euphrates has begun, said Erdogan. He considers the Syrian Kurdish party PYD and its allied militia YPG as sister organizations of the banned PKK. At the weekend Ankaras news agency Anadolu had reported that the Turkish army had bombed Kurdish positions on the eastern bank of the Euphrates.\n\n&gt; Left demands German help for Kurds\n\n&gt; \"The stabilization aid and the humanitarian support of the Federal Government for the people in the Idlib region are to be welcomed,\" said Left MP Evrim Sommer. \"But it must be ensured that they are used exclusively by the civilian population and that Erdogan-armed Islamist terrorist countries are not provided with German taxpayer money.\" If the German government really does provide \"principled assistance,\" it must also support the Kurds. A few days ago, the Turkish army also bombed places near the northern Syrian border town of Kobane. Kobane became known in 2014 because the Kurds, surrounded by the Turkish border and the \"Islamic State\", finally won there after a loss-making battle.""They keep quiet about which \"civilian actors\" they funded.""Because some people want it to be true very badly and don't even care to check the source.""It's been proven correct by Assad, Hafez al Assad. Bashar is certainly not his father.""You're very naive if you think that without these tyrants, you'll see people speaking their mind. The main sect of Islam is not compatible with liberalism, secularism, freedom of expression and these are pillars of a functioning modern democracy.\n\nThe alternative to these tyrants are in most cases Islamists which are by no means the kind to care about people speaking their mind. \n\nEven in much opened society like Turkey and Tunisia just go and criticize Islam and you'll see how free you are to speak your mind.""For now... Syria was hit harder, but it gets there. Libya is a non end story.""What racism? Where do you see racism in his post?\n\nThe road to democracy and freedom of speech is a social one as well. I doubt there were many demonstrators who really wanted freedom of speech as this is incompatible with mainstream Islam.""Lebanon is not a majority Sunni country. \n\nAbout Egypt, you would be very naive if you think a Muslim Brotherhood party would allow media to be free. They didn't control the army and were toppled before they could get the hands on it, otherwise... well just look at Turkey. \n\nAs about Tunisia, well as I said there's no freedom of speech(Islam can't be criticize) and let's see how much time it will last. There are still many seculars(thanks to the dictator!!), but it is very fragile and as I said just look at Turkey how quick everything could be screwed.""Haftar has not the support Assad has, Assad can always count on Alawites. I will be glad to see Haftar succeeding. \n\n""The lack of democracy in Muslim countries has almost nothing to do with dictators. Democracy is a social process as well. If society is not liberal and secular it won't succeed. And these 2 principles clash with Islam. For example if China and North Korea get rid of their regimes, the probability of these countries to become democracies is quite high. On the other hand in Sunni Islamic societies, well... Islam kinda run the show...""Lebanon strict laws about insulting religion exists because of Sunni Islam not being able to handle criticism. Lebanon, not being a majority Sunni country has much to do with the reason why Marcel Khalife got away with it after Sunni Muslims clerics have asked for him to be convicted for blasphemy.\n\nTunisia. There's no freedom of expression if you can't criticize everything, including religion. \n\nThe Islamists in Egypt had an easy majority and they would have had no matter economics. The country is very conservative. \n\n""Where did I said Sunni Muslims don't understand democracy? They do, it is just that for many the system is not compatible with their beliefs. As about Tunisia regressing from where it is , well look at Turkey... so don't be so sure...\n\nYou're not careful when reading. I was very clear that removing regimes/dictators could most likely lead to a democracy, like in the cases of China/North Korea. And how it has happened in Eastern Europe. I just doubt that this is the case for Sunni majority countries, where society is not up for it. ""And I explained to you that those laws exists because of the sectarian situation in which Lebanon is. Now imagine if people in Lebanon are free to criticize religious beliefs. What would happen if Christians could freely criticize Islam? Most likely civil war. That's the problem, they know what criticism of one particular religion can do and they choose to ban it for all.""It shouldn't be a matter of where you do. ""I do not assume. This is a fact as you can clearly see around the world. The reason is that Christianity is not Islam. Theologically it is more open and handle criticism way better than Islam. Religions are not the same, there are big differences between religions, even between sects within the same religion(especially within Islam). And these differences make their believers to behave different. It's quite obvious really.""People are not inherently better because they belong to one religion or other. Through, cultures, religions do influence peoples behaviour.\n\nAnywhere it seems you're jumping from one subject to another one which has nothing or little to do with the initial one. Christianity handling criticism better than mainstream Islam is true everywhere around the world. It's not specific to Lebanon and has nothing to do with peoples, as I already said. Or with Lebanese Civil War where you jumped on.\n\nAnd yes my coreligionists(assuming I'm religious)... They have done even worse. \n\n&gt; Sabra and Shatila was committed by Christians bent on cleansing Lebanon of Muslims so that it can be a Christian state. \n\nI thought they wanted PLO(foreigners) out. You now say they wanted all Muslims out or killed. Any evidence for this?""Hmmm, Bashir forty years ago. \n\nNowadays, forty years later we have one group who kill in the name of their religion, Sunni Islam. Nobody is singling out Sunni Islam, this is just fact.  Fact is only this religion is doing it. I just speak facts.""Is this the longest period without Israeli attacks since the beginning of the war?""I think this has less to do with S-300 deliveries and more with Russia vetoing Israeli attacks since the shootdown of the Il-20, whereas before that, the attacks were tolerated.""You forgot to switch accounts.""I'm pretty sure they came to Greece from Turkey.""Since the west is complicit in funding and arming militants, many of whom came to Syria from abroad,  they are also a \"product\" of Europe.""Maybe also good *for* Syria.""\"Desperate\" isn't a verb.""&gt; Whether or not Iraq is on the list, what the hell is the point of the sanctions if they're still able to do that much business?\n\nThose are not really exceptions, they will be hit by sanctions in 6 months if they're still buying iranian oil by then.\nThe US only selected those few countries for a smooth transition to an iran-free oil market because those 8 countries comprise 90% of iranian oil exports and they would destabilize the market if they had to turn to alternative sources immediately.\n""Eisenhauer?""Russia would miss out on some income by stopping to sell gas to Europe, whereas it wouldn't experience any direct repercussions from militants entering the EU.\n\nThis is speculative, but couldn't Turkey provide them with passage to North Africa, from which they could then reach Italy or Spain? ""What did he do?""&gt; How can it be this insanely difficult to take 3-4 small villages?\n\nIt isn't difficult. They just don't want to. For geopolitical reasons: namely keeping an alibi/pretext to justify US presence in the region and to deter a Turkish aggression. \n\nSome love to make distinctions about SDF and Kurds not being motivated to fight in arab areas but it's really just for geopol reasons. They had no such impediments when it was about taking the oil and gas rich areas along the notoriously IS-heartland Euphrates valley in a few weeks-long campaign, while the Raqqa battle was raging.""I respectfuly disagree. The US does need ISIS as a pretext, just look at the narrative involving At-Tanf operations; also, I think the US convinced themselves that they need a presence to counter Iran (and the many unwelcomed dynamics in the region*), I don't see the SDF having any real weight in that, let's be serious.\n\n\\* It's not just Iran. US needs leverage on Turkey, needs Israel to not fully entrust Russia with their security interests, they need the long-standing regional arab allies to know they're a major player that still has some swing if they want to keep an uncontested prime status in regional influence. US+Arab coalition lost the syrian revolution, it's part of US interests letting everyone know that defeating the US comes at the highest cost possible.""They're more outspoken about the need to counter iranian infuence but I don't think I dreamt the DoD &amp; Co underscoring the need to stay in Syria long term to prevent \"the resurgence of ISIS\".""Nobody said Turkey is Pakistan. Although is heading in a wrong direction.\n\nAnd no, criticizing Christianity in State will not get you killed and state will make everything to protect you. Just look at Christians reaction to a movie like The Da Vinci Code.\n\nTry to publically criticize Islam or its prophet and you'll be happy if Erdogan get his hands on you before some of his supporters do.""Whatever would we do if Captain Obvious didn't work for USAID?""Anyone knowledgeable about the in-depth context is more than welcome to comment. \n\nDespite about 5 years of following the conflict daily I don't think I'd be able to write right away more than a paragraph.\n\nedit: To what structure of command do they report to? Are they about entirely conscript force (as I think I read some time ago?) Have there been any recent announcement regarding future deployments?

I wonder how many times I read some headlines mistaking them for the latter.""There is no such thing""you pulled that number out of your ass and you know it""The deal has already collapsed, as Turkey didn't eliminate HTS from the DMZ by the 18th of October as it was supposed to.""The US government clearly prefers the latter.""Were any hostages actually rescued?""So, terrorism?""It's a tiny area though. They should be able to have guard posts within view of each other fully encircling the pocket.""Why should the militants take this ultimatum any more seriously than the previous one?""If there is proof, where is the problem with assigning blame ?""Or were women are banned from living if they get raped.""That's surprising, not because of the statement but because I thought this step would be postponed until the last ISIS pocket is gone.
