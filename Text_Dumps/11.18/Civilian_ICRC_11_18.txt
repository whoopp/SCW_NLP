Somehow I wonder, how much do they believe in their own propaganda.""The soldier training on the PKM is from the US, with a Turkish instructor next to him. Cross-training on weapons means that just as the Turkish soldiers will be taught how to handle US weapons, the US soldiers will be taught how to handle Turkish weapons.\n\nAlthough all of the soldiers will know how to sight in different weapons, using them in combat requires at least some knowledge of how they handle. To compare just one statistic the US M240 in the pictures weighs nearly three times as much as the Turkish PKM in the pictures, which will change how the soldier adapts to it.\n\n""I remember someone posting footage on here a while back of Turkish soldiers executing PKK POW's who had already been disarmed. If they're willing to commit war crimes by executing prisoners, it isn't a massive leap to believing that they would execute civilians as well, especially in the context of an active insurgency. The sniper thing is just absurd though.""Before OB I probably would have thought the same but during that operation there was a surprisingly large amount of reporting on it and a lot of discussion from regular people. I think if there is a Kobane operation people will remember the siege, arguably two of the most iconic photos of the war are the YPG soldier looking out over the ruined city and Turkish tanks watching across the border as the city was overrun by daesh. It was also the event that is seen as bringing the west into Syria in the first place, so it has a lot of meaning through that.\n\nI also wouldn't underestimate some of the underlying anti-Turkish sentiment in many countries. A lot of the comments from people that I mentioned before were fairly disgusted that Turkey was attacking \"the guys who fought ISIS for us\". It's also surprising how often the incident where Erdogan's bodyguards beat up protesters in Wahsington is brought up by Americans across the political spectrum.""I understand that soldiers occasionally commit crimes, my country (UK) had a number of soldiers tried a few years back for executing wounded Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. I'm not trying to suggest that it's common or purposeful in Turkey's case either.\n\nI was just trying to show how the narrative can be shaped to fit an agenda. If you have footage of soldiers killing POWs, you can start with rhetoric of \"well they kill unarmed people\", then when civilians are inevitably killed when they are caught up in battle, they can say \"see they're targeting civilians as well\". \n\nAlthough it's different in legal terms, if anyone sees a soldier shoot an unarmed and handcuffed man, they're going to think badly of them. If you want to set a narrative, it helps get readers into the mindset that that the soldiers are capable of doing criminal things, so they're more likely to believe it when you make up further claims.""\"And now we add some olivu\"""Olive oil is awful.

A number of users here were recently commenting that the East Euphrates Operation wasn't happening any time soon, as there hadn't been the military build up we've seen before. This could certainly change that depending on whether it's a routine deployment, show of force, or enough for a possible invasion. \n\nInterestingly, as well as the TSK deployment at Ras Al-Ayn, there was a report on an [FSA deployment opposite Tell Abyad](https://twitter.com/Tb2_Bayraktar/status/1058635550964494336). Assuming both are true, it would definitely signal the build up for a potential operation. The other option is that with the deployment of US forces preventing artillery strikes, Turkey is looking for another way to maintain pressure on the SDF, thus hindering their fight against daesh and souring US-SDF reations.

While 1,200 men is not an insubstantial number, both ES and OB involved upwards of 10,000 TFSA members alongside Turkish forces, so there will almost certainly be much greater deployments before any operation is attempted.""&gt; Either you condemn this behaviour across the board\n\nThese are specific indictments related to specific murders. It's not a press release, or 'condemnation across the board'. If there is specific information on death of French citizens, the French prosecutors are probably are under obligation to investigate and to issue indictments. How hard is it to comprehend.""A few people were speculating that it would be limited to a smaller stretch of the border but this confirms an offensive along the whole length of the SDF held Turkish-Syrian border. I think it's certainly the better option for Turkey, as the SDF will be hard pressed to defend the entire border.\n\nThe key problem is that 1200 TFSA fighters simply isn't going to be enough to take and hold an area that large without risking significant Turkish casualties. ES took 10,000-12,000 men and OB 10,000-25,000 men, both of which involved much smaller areas. An intriguing possibility given the Idlib ceasefire, is that Turkey could potentially use some of the groups there for this operation to bulk up the numbers. ""I think this is the perfect example of where the US \"border guard\" system falls down. Turkey bombed Tel Abyad, so the US put a small SOF group in the city to stop it, then Turkey just bombs a town or village a few miles down the road instead.""&gt; During ES they were not performing well against ISIS and the Turkish Army had to step in which cost a lot of lives of Turkish soldiers. But during OB with overwhelming Turkish air support they fulfilled their roles perfectly. Leading to minimal loss of life for Turkish troops. They performed much better.\n\nI think a lot of this came down to the implementation of a C&amp;C system and better training between the two operations. Their unification under the Syrian National Army and the division of the various factions into Legions formed from friendly groups meant that there was far less infighting and more clear goals for each group to achieve. Couple that with the months of training many groups received in Turkey and they became a much more cohesive fighting force.\n\n&gt; Turkey needs the FSA for its crossborder operations into Syria. It gives Turkish actions in Syria some semblance of legitimacy and it allows Turkey to build a loyal proxy.\n\nTurkey will definitely need a lot more FSA soldiers for an operation of this scale, so I think we'll have to keep a close eye on further deployments. Combined with the deescalation agreement in Idlib, a Turkish and FSA controlled North and East Syria would actually bring some bargaining power back to the rebels and change the dynamic of the war as it is currently.""While it's definitely possible that SOHR got it wrong, assuming they didn't I can see three likely explanations for the small number:\n\n1) The whole point is to only be a small deployment. The actual deployment of troops rather than just the usual Turkish rhetoric would definitely scare the SDF, causing them to pull back even further from the south and weaken their position. The small number of FSA deployed wouldn't affect operations elsewhere either, so it would be a win-win situation for Turkey.\n\n2) Training new FSA soldiers. Turkey is going to need a lot of FSA troops to successfully carry out the operation and then to hold the newly captured areas. They retrained a number of groups before OB and this could be the same case here. The small number could also indicate that this is to be a specialist formation for \"x\" task.\n\n3) This is simply the first deployment. The scale and numbers needed for the operation mean that secrecy would be virtually impossible. Combined with the fact that the SDF is already dug in along the border, there isn't any benefit to Turkey in rushing huge numbers of troops to the front there. This gives them time to bring troops in without destabilising the situation in Afrin with a large drain of soldiers.""Kind of sort of makes sense.""That's definitely an interesting point, taking the towns would also provide Turkey with much better security for the border crossings, the only problem is the US forces stationed in most of the major towns along the border at the moment.\n\nYour mention of Raqqa actually made me consider that as the possible target for the operation. Turkish forces could push straight down the road from Tel Abyad to Raqqa. The locals there aren't particularly fond of the SDF and Qiyam has a reasonable presence in the city as well. It would cut the DFNS in half and hasten the collapse of the SDF and possibly provoke the defection of the non-YPG elements.""Well, there is a standard of evidence to be met in order to issue an indictment. So the prosecutors feel that threshold has been met.""Yes, thank you.""So you claim. ""Ugh, what?

The sources, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the information, said that \"the Iraqi forces took control of 30 positions inside Syrian territory\". The sources said that the stations are 50 meters from the Iraqi border, fully fortified and surrounded by concrete.\n\n&gt; Last week, daesh regained control of 20 villages in Deir ez-Zor, close to the Iraqi border, after fierce fighting with US-backed Syrian forces that killed 70 people and wounded 200.\nAccording to fighters from the tribes of western Anbar, you can see a soldier on the Syrian side with the naked eye. According to international coalition sources, there are still 2,000 daesh fighters in the area, the last stronghold of the organisation in the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor, which includes Abu Kamal, which is less than 4 km from the Iraqi border.\n \n&gt; On Friday, Iraqi forces reinforced their positions on the border with Syria, two days after the SDF announced a temporary halt to their operations against an oppressive organisation on the other side of the border. The security sources said that \"seven brigades\" of the army, border guards, tribal fighters, and Popular Mobilisation Forces are now on the border with Syria. The sources estimated the number of troops by about 11,000 fighters, reinforced with equipment and modern military mechanisms, while extending barbed wire and installed thermal cameras. \n\n&gt; \"There is an air umbrella from Iraq and the international coalition,\" said Ahmad al-Mahallawi in Al-Qa'im, which borders Syria. He stressed that there are daily raids inside Syria against the positions of militants. Baghdad and Damascus announced in mid-October that the Abu Kamal crossing, opposite Al-Qa'im, would be reopened soon. \n\n&gt; After their redeployment in areas north of the Euphrates River in Syrian territory, daesh tried several times to enter Iraqi territory. Al-Qa'im, before its liberation last year, housed about 8,000 fighters, mostly Iraqis, who later fled to Syria. \n\n&gt; National security chief Qassim al-Araji said last week that the withdrawal of the SDF and the deployment of hostile elements instead to areas bordering Iraq \"carries question marks\". \"The withdrawal of the SDF and the redeployment of terrorist groups instead of them carries more than a question mark,\" said Araji, who formerly served as interior minister. Araji called on the security forces to \"take caution\", stressing \"the need for constant readiness\". Former Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi said last week that the activity of a pro-Syrian organisation poses a threat to Iraqi territory.\n\n&gt; Iraq is on the brink of getting involved in the Syrian crisis and new Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi faces the daunting task of rebuilding large parts of the country after a devastating three year long war. At first, Abdul Mahdi was expected to nominate a full list of 22 ministers, including interior and defence portfolios, but Sadr's bloc, backed by Sadr's leader Moqtada al-Sadr, objected to the nomination of some names, leaving those ministries vacant.\n \n&gt; Some political parties have hinted that Abdul Mahdi may issue a decision to storm Iraqi forces into Deir ez-Zor because of the size of the forces that have reached the border, in order to block any attempt to return the organisation to the country, which could destroy the prime minister's project which has only just begun.\n\n&gt; Informed security sources say that so far no instructions have been issued to move more than the \"Syrian outposts\" that Iraqi forces have recently controlled. The sources said that as the situation on the ground changed, Iraq's borders are once again endangered when only a week ago they bordered a friendly country, but the Iraqi decision so far is the capture of border sites only. \n\n&gt; For his part, Eid Ammash Karbouli, a member of the Anbar Provincial Council and the tribe in the border areas was in contact with al-Mada yesterday that \"the storming of Iraq to the occupied Syrian areas of daesh requires the approval of the Syrian side\". The local official points out that there is a great danger for Iraqi forces, because they will have to fight directly with the extremist organisation, where there are no official Syrian forces in the areas of northern Euphrates.\n\n&gt; Frequent threats coming from the border with Syria push up to 60,000 people to return to their homes in the border town of Al-Qai'm, as well as the lack of services and power cuts. \n\"There are 150 houses completely destroyed because of the military operations and the occupation of the city, and there is no money so far for reconstruction.\" In return, international organisations were able to assist civilians in the reconstruction of 1600 houses that had been partially damaged.""They cite unnamed military sources saying that they've taken over the border positions but they need both Syrian and Iraqi government permission to move any further.""That was definitely the impression I got from the article. They just want to get on with rebuilding their country without having to worry about daesh wandering back across the border at any moment.""It's a really good article, as it covers all of the major aspects of the political relationships between Turkey and their FSA partners.

The media has to detach and dehumanise the victims in order to justify the killing. Firstly, they introduce the the idea that the weaponry is indirect, thus the casualties are unintentional, so the US isn't to blame because it wasn't deliberate. Then making the point that they are IS families strips them of their identity as civilians, which doesn't legitimise the killing but makes it *sound* more legitimate. The end result is the above comment where the killing is seen as bad but not as bad as *deliberately* killing *normal* civilians.\n\nEDIT: Just to clarify, this isn't an attack on /u/iseetheway, I'm just as susceptible to this sort of media view warping a anyone else and I'm willing to admit that exactly the same sort of thought crossed my mind reading the article title.""I'd like to point out, that many people here have their own biases.

When in reality the sectarian divide's history is much short and grounded in modern history of the last 50 years. Yes i know there was issues but the sectarian nature didn't have such a strong political memory among communities.  There are Alawite communities who are poor and disadvantaged.

However there are still major issues in political representation and the use of the Kurdish language in a political context. Politicians can and are still arrested for using the Kurdish language in official speeches or written addresses. There is also some repression of Kurdish parties, with parties with a large Kurdish following often being banned and/or having their members arrested.""It doesnt need to be shocking to be posted here.""&gt;At the start of Syria\u2019s popular uprising in 2011, a group of young activists from Daraya, a suburb of Damascus, became known for their philosophy of non-violence.

That's something new to me.""Sorry.\n\nWhat I meant was that US didn't think of long term consequences of their actions. They didn't care for possible problems after 2003 in Iraq, and it's commonly known that this war was the biggest catalyst for ISIS uprising/creation. I'm no conspiracy theorist, but US was okay with ISIS spreading, up until it begun hitting their own interests in Iraq - then they acted. And here, seven years later, ISIS still exists and still fights.\n\nSo in my opinion, there cannot be any \"new ISIS\" (whatever that means) to come from Iran. If anything, there could be one - but only if USA decided on invasion again. Then it could happen very fast. Out on itself, Iran is fighting ISIS itself, via militias in Syria. I don't think they really want anything like that near their territory.""This seems rather like a rather bizarre choice to make considering the position the group holds. The Al-Sanadid Forces are probably the best integrated Arab force within the SDF and they have an extremely good relationship with the PYD/YPG. They have also been fairly cooperative with the US in the past.\n\nIt also seems like dreadful timing for both the SDF and the US. With the DeZMC being battered during the recent daesh counterattack and disputes with Arab tribal leaders, the SDF and the US need friendly Arab groups such as Al-Sanadid more than ever.""As poor quality as the comment you replied to was, surely your aware that your own strawmanning looks just as bad? Yes, the Israelis are occupying Palestinian territory, that doesn't justify terrorism and murdering civilians. Furthermore, the original commenters use of the phrase \"Jewish occupiers\", as opposed to Israeli occupiers, puts the blame on Jews rather than Israelis.
