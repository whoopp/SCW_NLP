""Ghadaffi is clearly not a success story.  He was unable to prevent the rebellion from achieving a critical mass.

But these dictators would be stupid to ignore the risk of outside intervention. Even Assad came very very close to ending up like Ghadaffi and Saddam. ""&gt; Assad has more or less proved this correct, hasn't he.\n\nI think part of what he proved is that many of the authoritarian governments in the region need foreign benefactors in order to keep stability. Assad struggled to maintain control over his own country, and that in made him very vulnerable to interference from Turkey and SA. Once he got bigger commitments from Russia, he was able to stabilize the situation.""&gt; You can think arabs are too dumb to want freedom or democracy\n\nThis most definitely is not true, but democracy requires well established institutions and organizations to function correctly. Most of the institutions in the area are controlled by Islamic leaders and are not supportive of democracy as we know it. I think it is fair to question whether the arab world can establish democracies in this kind of environment even if they overthrow a dictator and hold elections. If they stay with their Islamic roots, they essentially need to create a new way of running a democracy and we do not really know what that looks like - not an easy task by any means. Even in good conditions, this kind of process would take decades.\n\nAnd of course, this is all complicated even more by the fact that competing foreign influences abound, and are typically supporting things that will help the foreigners rather than the citizens (ie. not democratic at all).""Most internal conflicts have external players taking part.

Most likely this failure to address the underlying problems of corruption and autocracy will sow the seeds of the next conflict 20-30 years down the line.""All this began with people just protesting against the government. You can blame all you want on America, but the war began as a native protest.\n\n\nJust because it\u2019s been turned into a proxy war by American politicians wanting to thumb their noses at Iran, it doesn\u2019t mean the entire war was nothing more than a Western plot.

This bypasses a criminal court case, where the owner would have a fair chance to defend himself or herself. In this way, the government can unfairly take property.\n\nZimbabwe seized the land of white farmers.
