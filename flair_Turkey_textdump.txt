"Also no bombings in cities""Well USA is also there so big game changer. Russia knows that as well.  Russia would never risk going to war with the U.S to defend Syria even they know that. Why you think Russia done nothing against SDF? Unfortunately Assad on the other hand is cocky and thinks he can liberate all of Syria but without ousting the NATO forces there that would be impossible. Also U.S would never think of losing the NATO ally of Turkey to a rag tag AK wielding Communist militia in Syria.""It is not really fair to compare anonymous soldiers uploading pictures of enemy combatants they have killed and the military command officially parading dead bodies in the streets of a city.""It definitely is. There are a few Turkish citizens fighting in the ranks of TFSA.""[this is all I can hear whilst reading this](https://youtu.be/U1mlCPMYtPk)""It's like reading foreign policy from Dick Cheney's mentally challenged little brother.

My dad still speaks his original tongue, however I don't. \n\nOppression towards Kurds has also dropped significantly. This year when I went to Tunceli (Dersim being the Kurdish name), it said \"Dersime ho\u015fgeldiniz\" (meaning welcome to Dersim) on the highway. I was shocked at first, since Kurdish names are banned , at least I thought so. Even soldiers I know who work there refer to Tunceli as Dersim lol\n\nThe locals have really pushed away the PKK, all throughout Turkey. Especially now that the military is winning, the locals have stopped the whole autonomous dream. People now just want this was to end. This is probably this closest we've gotten to ending this war. (And no that cease fire was a massive joke, both sides were arming themselves to the teeth) \n\n\n\n""If Turkey supported terrorism with all their economic capacity they still wouldn't compare to the United States efforts that have been going on for decades. Perhaps you should question your government's role in selling 110 billion worth of arms to Saudi Arabia before getting angry about Turkey taking actions against millitias that are ideologically linked to the PKK on their borders. \n\n""Speaking from Turkey\u2019s history, it fucking sucks.\n\nYou cannot harm a country\u2019s future more than anything else.\n\nSyrian government should try to get those people back after SCW ends.

That's a fuckton of explosives. \n\nI don't think this stuff would've been used in a massive carbomb, rather to be distributed to the various provinces to be used in IEDs. Since such attacks are more useful and lead to more enemy casualties for the PKK/HPG. \n\nGreat catch however, definitely saved the lives of many Turkish security personal and possibly some innocent civilians. \n\n\n""No yeah these guys didn't cross into Syria, I think they probably had some kind of weapons/explosives stash house close to the border. Most likely bought a lot of stuff from Syria in many years, all stashed up for later use. \n\n&gt;The PKK hasent launched attacks since the city war\n\nYeah no that's not true, just today (November 1) four PKK/HPG were killed in Diyarbak\u0131r/Lice. They tried ambushing a group of J\u00d6H personal. They probably got spotted before they managed to get close enough, providing the troops with enough time to counter ambush them. \n\nAnd this is just today's example. Both the PKK and Turkish security forces continue to attack eachother on a daily basis. (Mostly the Turks however). \n\n""Don't read the news dude, read the actual police/gendarmerie report, I don't think they claimed the possible bombers came from Syria. \n\n""https://twitter.com/anadoluajansi/status/1057905203524055040?s=19\n\nA lot of cables and other stuff was also captured.

Although this was initially just a political split, because of the unity of political and religious leadership in the early Islamic system this turned into religious differences over hundreds of years.\n\nSunnis believe that anyone could be the political/religious leader. Shias generally believe that leadership can only lie in the descendents of Mohammed's son-in-law Ali. Shias themselves are split into several different sects, the largest being the one that runs Iran and Iraq. Syria is run by a different shia sect, the alawites, and Yemen's Houthis are from a third, the Zaydis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;""May she rest in peace, the worst fucking thing is civilian dying, especially the most innocent. \n\nOne thing however, [the YPG claims a Turkish sniper shot her in the head.](https://twitter.com/DefenseUnits/status/1058019555988135936?s=19)\n\nWhich I doubt is the case. Turkish border guards are equippet with .338 Lapua magnum and 12.7x99mm rounds, both rounds would've completely destroyed her head should any one of them hit her. \n\nI believe she died due to artillery shrapnel, still doesn't make her death any less important. But claiming she was killed by sniper fire makes it seem like the Turkish military is intentionally targeting civilians (which obviously isn't the case). \n\n""interesting read, I don\u2019t agree with some small remark but good overall.""Depends on the branch mainly. Border guards are only equipped with M95 (12.7x99mm)  and AWM 338 (.338 Lapua magnum) rifles. \n\nHowever other branches (like army infantry, Gendarmerie SOF, Army SOF and Navy SOF) are equipped with 7.62x51mm NATO rounds. (KNT-76, Bora-12 and M110 SASS) ""To be fair, I know way to little about the .338 Lapua magnum round to safely say its effect on the human body. \n\nAll I know its heavier and faster than the 7.62x51, and we all know how much damage that can do. Granted its definitely possible that a .338 lapua magnum round can graze ones head and do minimal damage, however not sure/likely. (mainly because its quite a heavy projectile and has an insane speed, according to Wikipedia its 12.96 grams at a speed of 1005 ms^-1). \n\nAs for the .50 BMG. I mean I've heard those rounds fire, and just its sound is already scary. It echoed like thunder, granted it was in valley so it makes sense, but just the size and mass of that thing is scary. A 42 gram bullet and 950+ ms^-1 speed, yeah that is just crazy. \n\nI mean, there also numerous video's and pictures of people getting hit by.50 cal rounds, those things are no joke. I'm fairly certain even a graze from a .50 cal will do massive damage. \n\nIf you really want proof, [Here are some pictures from Mu\u015f / Varto](https://twitter.com/turanordus/status/1050130275206946816)(VERY NSFW/L).

Unfortunately. \n\n&gt;Does it make more humane or justified she died by bombings instead of being executed?\n\nObviously it doesn't, the poor child is still dead. However I believe it is a major war crime to purposefully target civilians, especially with rifles that have pinpoint accuracy. \n\nThe YPG/J is trying to paint this image that the Turkish military is picking off civilians one by one because of their ethnicity etc. (obviously not true). Same goes for the Turks, they claim they are there to save the civilians from \"terrorism\" and never hurt a single civilian. (obviously also a lie). ""Am I seeing stuff wrong, or is the US soldier manning the PK machine gun wearing a Woodland cap? I had always thought woodland was phased out of service. (appears some soldier in the back also have woodland caps).\n\nAlso finally seeing army infantry with their new uniforms (see the soldier standing in the back). its the same style used by the Navy SOF, Air Force CSAR and Gendarme. \n\n[Some more pictures of the convoys](https://twitter.com/TarMilus/status/1058033528435290112), really shows how fucking massive the silhouette of the Kirpi II is compared to the M-ATV. Than again the M-ATV only has 5/6 crew, whilst 15 or so people fit inside the Kirpi II. \n\nOne more thing, how come US forces still utilize these manned turrets, the gunner becomes really vulnerable to (sniper)fire in urban areas. Not to mention a RCWS has a much further range/accuracy pus night vision capabilities (or superior night vision capabilities I should say). ""Well the Turkish soldiers are firing an M249 and M240, both weapons aren't in use by the Turkish armed forces, so it makes sense the Turkish troops are trained/helped in using them. \n\nSame thing with the PKM, Turkish soldier assisting a US soldier with the PKM MG. \n\n""Depends on how you define it. You are correct in the fact that we only see a difference if forces actually not friendly with ypg are the rulers of manbij. If x force is viewed very negatively then people allied with them claiming to replace them does not change anything, any other country in an equivalent situation would feel the same. The problem is being in too much of a bubble to understand why someone wouldn't find ypg to be an amazing flawless force for good. Also, that belligerent stance that even includes ypg going against US' agreements would be great news for turkey, I hope they follow your strategy. ""Because taking on a few villages left controlled by ISIS is nothing compared to having the US shield you against Turkey that wants to end ypg's existance? It's really not going to end up pretty if the ypg stops giving the US a reason to support them. Not that I would be complaining personally if YPG is curious to see how such a scenario would work out. ""The primary reason for the intervention in the first place was ISIS, and it's still officially one of the main reasons. If YPG are not obedient allies to the US then supporting ypg for those strategic interests is pretty useless. ""Turkish cease-fire observation posts along the front line between the rebels and Assad. Any attack carries a strong risk of causing Turkish casualties which would have a risk of triggering more Turkish direct or indirect intervention under the guise of protecting the lives of the Turkish troops.\n\nPretty much every route towards Idlib from regime-controlled areas has a set of Turkish observation posts on it. There is no way to advance without the fighting enveloping a Turkish army position.""No it isn't? As long as the US is neutral or even only lightly supportive of ypg, Turkey is perfectly capable of taking them on. You made a point about how what I said about ypg needing to be an obedient ally to merit US support also applies to Turkey, well it's not equivalent for the simple reason that ypg needs that heavy US support to be able to survive given its neighbours, Turkey doesn't need the tiniest bit of US support to be able to fight ypg. So Turkey's importance as an ally for the US is irrelevant for the topic either way. You're moving the goalposts by saying Turkey has to be the most strategically important country in the universe for the US in order for Turkey to not be in a million years equivalent to the ypg. Neither 'Technology and geopolitics', nor Turkey's economy have changed anywhere near drastically enough to make a seven decade long US ally in one of the most strategic locations there is ever even remotely comparable with ypg. ""Yes. Officially this is a \"de-escalation\", not a stalement. In reality there is no difference.""What does Antep or Mardin have to do with Syrian Civil War?

The offensive side really did a number on the defenders, 23 KIA with such an attack is really impressive. Especially if they really have zero KIA themselves. (Which is what they claim) \n\nThe place also looks really filthy, I don't understand how people live in between their own filth and trash. \n\nAt last, how come only four of the 23 KIA had ranks, IIRC four LTs and the others had no ranks, how come?(at least the recently released list only contained four ranked personal) \n\n May they all rest in peace.

It's clear that civilians aren't targeted in this curfew, at least for the time being. \n\nSupposedly some Shuheda al Sharqiyyah members have been killed and some have been arrested by security forces. \n\nAccording to pro-Kurdish Twitter sources the Shuheda al Sharqiyyah refused orders from the Turkish military.

(Street names have changed however). One thing that has appeared in ES territories are poster of KIA troops praising them. [Example of KIA Infantry Senior Lieutenant (Piyade \u00dcste\u011fmen) Tar\u0131k KO\u00c7O\u011eLU (2009-10)](https://imgur.com/a/ql23nqU) and [KIA Infantry Major (Piyade Binba\u015f\u0131) B\u00fclent ALBAYRAK (1999-147)](https://imgur.com/a/Hf7qh4L).\n\nSuch posters are pretty common in ES territories, not sure if they have been placed in OB territory as of yet.

Say stuff like Bulbul in Arabic,  Bilbil in Kurdish and B\u00fclb\u00fcl in Turkish, the same place with three different names. Obviously the group in charge will name the place according to their own liking, say the SDF/YPG referring to Ayn al-Arab as Koban\u00ee. Should the SAA/Syrian Government be in control of that region they would've referred to it as Ayn al-Arab and not Koban\u00ee. ""Wait didn't they use the Iraqi Turkmen flag but with red instead of white? Nonetheless both flag look a like, obviously has traits from the Turkish flag. \n\nI like the blue flags, really nice feel to them. I personally love the Seljuk and Crimean Tatar flags. ""&gt;  a future as Turkey's primary proxy in Syria at the expense of Arabs?\n\nThis could very well be the case, I can see Turkish government ditch certain \"extremist/corrupt\" groups (Euphemism for groups that don't cooperate) in favor of Syrian Turkmen forces. The ideological view of Syrian Turkmens most likely aligns with the mind set of the Turkish government, thus less likely they will collide. ""Town names change when translated, it's possible that it is infact just the town name translated to Turkish. (Like Bilbil, Bulbul, B\u00fclb\u00fcl) \n\n""&gt;there is no place to go but gerilla.\n\nI think you mean guerilla ? \n\nShould Turkey go on a full fledge invasion(hypothetically) , the SDF/YPG wont stand a change. Than again the Turkish economy wont be able to stand should Turkey invade. ""Gerilla means Guerilla(fighter) in Kurmanci but also Hungarian I believe. \n\nThe YPG won't be able to defeat the Turkish military with conventional  or asymmetrical warfare for that matter. \n\nAll that will be left, should the Turks invade, would be cells here and there doing minimal damage. A resistance will continue, how effective it is is debatable. \n\nOne thing is certain, no such operation will happen. (A full TSK invasion into SDF territory). \n\n""Pretty much. While the Gulenists were a secretive Islamic cult subverting the state, they knew how to do a good job. Many are highly educated and they (somewhat intentionally) became crucial parts of the bureaucratic machine that is the Turkish State. Ever since the coup, loyalty to Erdogan is pretty much the only real qualification left. I can't feel bad for him since he brought this on himself.  ""Note: Turkey almost always complies with ECHR's decisions otherwise she has to pay some amount of compensation.\n\nEdit: Erdogan: \"The decision doesn't bind us, we will make our counter move and be done with it.\" I don't know what he meant by that but i guess it's safe to assume Mr. Demirtas will stay in the jail at least 'till 31st March (Municipal elections).""If you're going to say something like that you have to provide a source.""Yeah, you kinda do have to prove it. Mainly because it doesn't exist, nobody ever heard of something like that. The whole country would be discussing something else if Demirta\u015f actually threatened terrorist attacks on live TV, and the TV station would be closed too. Also there would be millions of recordings of it all over the internet if it existed, wouldn't be hard to find.""Can\u2019t or won\u2019t ?""Mr. Sharfan doesn\u2019t seem to realise that they are short of one canton""If they really think that's gonna make Turkey calm they're in for a surprise lol.

It is a measure to counter Turkey for sure because i don't think it is to seperate US troops from YPG and help a Turkish operation in the area. This kind of statements get a quick condemnation from the ministry foreign affairs regardless of the time. I also wonder what will be Erdo\u011fan's first response to this.""As  reliable as palmistry.""Anarchist revolution backed by the superpower neo-imperialist USA.\n\nAnd some of the people affiliated to this movement(especially westerners) actually pretend to take inspiration from the Cuban revolution. ""When it's going great it's always the mighty YPG taking credit and when shit hits the fan it's always Arab components of the SDF. ""When a bunch of captured YPG millitants got roughed up in a bus there weren't enough superlatives to condemn the rebel perpetrators. Islamist scum, jihadist, they're like ISIS. And yet here we have summary executions and most of what I'm hearing is \"well it's guerilla warfare, they can't really hold them captured\".\n\nWhich really I can't even argue against because that is relatively true. But looking back I'm just susprised that during the OB operation and after years and years of the most brutal kind of violence and inhumane behaviour in Syria people on this sub managed to be unconsolably indignant about some YPG prisoners getting slapped on a bus. That just stuck with me.\n\n""Being captured by ISIS is the last thing I'd wish on anyone. The one light at the end of the tunnel is that maybe due to their position ISIS is willing to trade prisoners instead of executing them. ""US boots will need to come on the ground if this continues. Which will be a disaster for Trump. ""Saudi special forces can't even deal with Yemeni rebels let alone hardened ISIS fighters. That shit is a myth or a political statement. ""The lack of awareness and the eagerness to delfect responsibility is astounding. Lets assume for a second that everyone involved in the failures in DeZ is Arab.\n\nEven then YPG is partly responsible for these failures. YPG originally captured the areas in DeZ. The YPG founded the MCs, the DeZ ones as well. The YPG receives all of the heavy and light equipment from the americans. They are also responsible for its destribution. The YPG is also de facto in charge of all of the MCs they decide strategy, tactics and priorities. After the US of course. \n\nSo even in the best case scenario the YPG is still heavily involved in the failures of DeZ.

(If only Turkey wasn't an existential threat for the SDF)\n\n&gt;Erdogan has demanded that the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS end its support for the YPG, saying Tuesday that \"this is an opportunity for those who say that they are allies, that they are strategic partners, and who want to carry our relations to the future by strengthening our ties politically, economically and militarily.\"\n\n\nAgain regarding the new outposts the US set up. \n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWith this wording Erdo\u011fan is expressing his frustrations with the current US involvement in Syria. Obviously he can't go around and claim to 'hit/kill' US Marines like he did in the past. Since shit is hitting the fan and the US is consistent with supporting the YPG (for the time being), Erdo\u011fan needs to be a bit more political with his wording. \n\nIt will be interesting what will happen once DeZ is cleared from ISIS, I suppose the US will now claim their presence is to counter Iranian influence in the region.\n\n""&gt;ISIS is very much present in Syria, in no small numbers, and is inflicting casualties both to the regime and to the SDF forces\n\n\nHow many ISIS members would be left in Syria? Most definitely not 3000+, they are somewhat finished. ISIS has lost major ground throughout the years and have now even shifted their battles to Guerilla style attacks, exploiting the weather for their advantage.\n\nThe only reason they have been inflicting casualties is due to poor performance of the SDF, the Hajin pocket fiasco is a laughable disaster. There are tops 1000 ISIS members left in the Haijan pocket. \n\nEven without coalition support, I personally expect the SDF to be able to deal with these few ISIS militants. If not the DeZMC, the well trained YPG/J should be able to deal with them.\n\n\n\n""There still is a minor insurgency, mainly fighting the TFSA/Rebel occupiers. For some reason Turkish forced still haven't been targeted :/ \n\n\nBut yes mostly the YPG and their Apoistic ideology has been kicked out of the Afrin Canton. ""I suppose for the national security of the Turkish republic , having a De facto/semi autonomous state run on a Apoistic political system (the DFNS) , right on the border could be seen as a problem. \n\nHowever I don't think the current solution the Turkish government came up with works. You can't just invade land and not take care of the consequences. It's very wrong what is happening in Afrin, instead of TFSA controlled territory, the area needs to be governed by Turkish authorities directly. "
