Like the Cuban Embargo during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Very nearly the same, except embargos limit certain goods (usually war material) and if a ship is found without said goods it can go. \n\nRegardless, no one thinks this is serious. ""There's the subtext that advisors are  embedded with some SAA units to the extent that they are actively under fire - especially during the battles in Eastern Syria last year. ""They didn't lose many personnel retaking Palmyra and far fewer than \"hundreds\" of mercenaries were killed in that attack after the smoke of misinformation had cleared. ""From the SVBIEDs yesterday or from today? ""&gt; Vytautas was talking about the dishes on the TELARs and that those could be used without the main engagement radar. This is not true imo.\n\nHe was correct in that statement:    \n \"*So even if main radars are destroyed, these can still function in* **limited operational** *capability.*\"\n\nSometimes you do not need 'big boys' or in case off emergency - so, both 'V' TELAR version can use their own illumination radar - which is usually used for data links, in case of VTM version of missiles. \n\nVTM meaning&gt; *Track-Via-Missile* - a guidance technique which combines semi-active radar homing (SARH) and radio-command guidance (i.e. operator retain full command over missile path:\n\nFrom Wikipedia - advantages of TVM:      \n\n- Unlike an active radar homing missile, the missile does not alert the target to the fact that it is homing in on it by illuminating it with radio waves. Typically, the target will be aware that it is being illuminated by the SAM radar, but it will not know for certain if it has been engaged. Modern phased-array radars, by virtue of their thin beams and low sidelobes make detection by the aircraft even more difficult.     \n- Unlike semi-active radar homing missiles, the electronics needed to calculate and follow an interception path do not need to be built into each missile, reducing their complexity, weight and cost. It is also possible to make the missiles more accurate by using more sophisticated algorithms for calculating interception than would be possible in the limited processor in a missile. In addition, it is possible for operators to adjust the missile's flight path throughout the engagement, even during the terminal homing phase.    \n- Unlike radio command guided missiles, because the missile's radar receiver is much closer to the target than the ground station, more accurate tracking information can be generated for the system's computer. It is also more difficult to jam or spoof the tracking signal.    \n- It is also possible for the ground station to receive direct radar reflections from the target (rather than the data downloaded by the missile) and combine the two sources of information to generate the interception course. This adds an extra element of ECM resistance to the system.      \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track-via-missile\n\nEDIT:\n\nThis is situation where combined group of TELARs from Buk-M2E and S-300V (Antey 2500) work only with their  own illumination radars - it is a possible situation in the battlefield, where main radar are not still deployed or it is heavily jammed:      \nhttp://i.imgur.com/5UTWf5s.jpg (Venezuelan Military example)   ""The running speculation is that these are second/ third hand from Libya, where quantities of FALs came from both Libyan government stocks and were supplied by gulf states.""Supposedly, but they in no way explained the amount of FALs that the rebels had back in 2012/13 - these rifles showing up in numbers were among the first signs of foreign arms supplies. ""Type 1 receivers too...there are American collectors who would salivate over these examples. ""Anything can be easily modified to full auto, or something that mimics full auto.""Its Nedaa. So probably not very. \n\nAlso, the link is broken. It links to the website, not the article. ""IIRC, they were from an old government cache found in Aleppo - hard to know how many of them survived, but the most interesting attempt to utilize a STG-44 involved mounting it on a robot. ""&gt; thinking about it i have not seen 300V described with TVM?\n\nFor example&gt;      \nthe latest known modification of missile 48N6DM (48N6E3), with a maximum range of 250 kilometers, at 10-30,000 meters altitude and ballistic targets at distances between 7 and 60 kilometers. It is in service from 2007 in systems like S-300V4 and S-400, also and in S-400F (on upgraded Kirov, Project 11442M). \n\n&gt; If you look at the 2 axis mounting it is meant to follow targets, not to do search patterns. They are claimed with ~14 kW continous wave, also not what you need to search and track targets 50 miles away. \n\nEarly warning radars, let's say, like 'Nebo-M' will do the search, then if necessary, TELAR from 'V' system or 'Buk\" can track and engage targets on their own. Radar is actually almost the same as with 'Buk-M2', around 25 KW which is translated as 50-70 Km. This erected must on TELAR 9M83 'Gladiator' will allow practical solo targeting height at 35 meters low for around 30 Km distance.   \n  \nOne interesting capability of 9M83 'Gladiator', is that this TELAR **can** act as master fire/command/engagement post for 'Buk-M2' attached systems with inter exchange data-link (no needs for 'Ranzhir', 'Polyana'... etc.), where attached 'Tor' and 'Tunguska' systems are in autonomous mode as close point-of-defense.\n\nOne can imagine tracked colon of tanks and other vehicles, which were suddenly engaged with significant air born assets while on march. So, reaction time of system on the march is from &lt;2 seconds for 'Tor' and 'Tunguska' (*edit: they can fire missiles 'on-the-move'*), up to 4-20 seconds for 'Buk' and then up to one minute for S-300V. That also allow those TELARs and attached TELs, to defend themselves and in case of heavily jammed situation, with no battery/regiment engagement radar operational or downed wide network data-links.  \n\n""I don't remember the source, but I read that they disagreed over who would form the leadership of JWT, they also didn't participate in the fraternal fighting.

wounded by the \"Sham Liberation\" during the storming of the town of Kfarhalb in the countryside of western Aleppo.\n\nAnab correspondent in the countryside of Aleppo today, Friday, October 5, that the storming \"Liberation of the Levant\" of the town came suddenly, which prompted the people to take out demonstrations against it, killing two children and wounding a woman as an initial result.\n\nActivists from Aleppo countryside published pictures of the two children and apologized for not publishing them.\n\nThe correspondent explained that the storming of the town caused by the attempt to \"free the Sham\" arrest leader of the \"National Liberation Front,\" Raed Aboud.\n\nThere are currently confrontations between \"Liberation of the Sham\" and elements of the \"National Front\" in the town, according to the leader of the \"Front\", Abdul Salam Abdul Razzaq.\n\nMy family got a sound recording for a resident of Kfarhmara and said that ambulances were not allowed to enter the town to evacuate the wounded and the civilian victims.\n\nAccording to the registration revolves violent confrontations between the two factions, and there is a neighborhood completely surrounded by the \"Liberation of the Sham\".\n\nIt is not the first time that the towns of the countryside of Aleppo, west of the clashes of the party \"Liberation of the Sham\", and previously was with the \"movement of Nur al-Din Zanki,\" which impose its influence on large areas in the region.\n\n\"The latter claimed that they would carry out a security campaign to organize the state and the frogs, and mobilized their forces since yesterday evening, in addition to dozens of machine guns and tanks, and tried to enter the village and prevented the residents.\n\nThe authorities, including the account of the \"Abu Saraka legitimate\", \"After the siege of the village and shelling, the residents were surprised that the body stormed the houses of the elements of the National Liberation Front (Zanki), and arrested and developed things and began clashes between the elements of the village who broke into the house and then sent the body and Zanki frames and began a violent battle \"He said.\n\nThe Liberation of the Sham did not comment on the confrontations and their causes until the time of writing this report.\n\nThe confrontations come days after similar similarities between the Liberation of the Sham and the Army of the Liberals in the town of Zardana in the northern countryside of Idlib, injuring two people from the city of Pensh.\n\nAnd coincides with a state of security chaos experienced by Idlib, killing dozens of civilians and military.\n\nThe \"Liberation of the Sham\" recently accused the cells of organizing the \"Islamic State\" to stand behind the state of chaos, and said it is working to eliminate them in several areas Idlib and countryside.\n\nThe \"Liberation of the Sham\" has entered into confrontations with the other factions operating in Idlib, most notably the recent fighting with the \"Syrian Liberation Front\", preceded by fighting with the movement \"Ahrar Sham Islamic\".""I'm confused. Who attacked who and to what result?""Definitely, presumably a lot of it is acquired online and then brought in via Turkey. Some of it might be Chinese made airsoft parts too, something that is apparently common in Iraq. ""From what I gather HTS conducted a raid in a Zinki controlled town under the pretext of arresting those seeking reconciliation with the government. Led to some reported clashes with Zinki faction within JWT, some claims of Zinki members being arrested alongside those seeking reconciliation and HTS also capturing some equipment and vehicles from the organization.""The biggest deception has been several actors in Syria downplaying or outright denying the extent that they have kept the civil war going. Turkey's probably the most egregious, but the Americans maintaining a narrative of the war that shifts blame away from their support of the opposition is also no better. ""Interesting. Thank you. ""The Americans have in part facilitated the logistics for the rebels through the coordination centers they set up, through selling new arms to the Gulf states to replace the surplus they sent to the Syrian rebels, through amounts of money dedicated to training and propping up opposition media outlets etc. All this occurred even before the SDF was created.""Remind me what the second round is after JTS-HTS?""Perhaps forced to after earlier armour losses against HTS.""Ahh, gotcha. I view it all as one episode in the fraternal fighting, with a few attempted ceasefires and mediations along the way.\n\nNot sure how big this fighting will come to be though, already agreement in place between HTS and local council and talks underway to restore calm. Just another of the many minor clashes in the opposition areas.\n\n ""Ok let's just ignore the massive influx of Turkish shilling exactly when OB started\n&gt;When operation ES\nNot a justification to invade Syria, despite already doing so prior\n&gt;When TAF reach Al-Bab\nAgain, maybe stay in turkey?\n\nWhere's the justification for the genocide down the coast - kinsabba, for example?

""Thank you.""&gt;By actively targeting media staff, the regime also made it too dangerous for journalists to visit opposition-held areas. This has allowed it to conduct its subsequent rampages under a pall of uncertainty, assisted by its Western apologists.\n\nThe irony of this statement is that while the author uses it to claim that the regime is ultimately the root of all evil in the conflict and then criticizes \"apologists\" for making a false moral equivalency about the violence that the parties meted out, he promptly glosses over how western journalists were roving around opposition areas well into 2013 (particularly in Aleppo) until high profile kidnappings like that of John Cantile made it clear that western journalists were vulnerable in general and could not rely on the opposition to guarantee their safety.\n\nThe author also dramatizes Colvin's exploits to make up for the lack of hard evidence to prove that the attack that killed her was actually specifically targeting her. [It is far more likely that she was collateral damage from the same indiscriminate shelling she was seeking to report on.](https://www.joshualandis.com/blog/marie-colvins-death-tragic-random/)""Well, there are many ways, but two-way are most usual&gt;     \n\nFirst, military school and then after some years (depending on military, i.e. country, period of mandatory service after the school) one may try to find a job elsewhere,\n\nSecond, join the Army as conscript or volunteer, get combat experience and then find a job...\n\nI somehow combined those two-way: First joined Army as regular conscript, then joined SOF, saw some actions abroad, then as instructor finished some military schools and courses, then find my first job as advisor/trainer abroad, saw some action/combat/wars, been lucky to survive and stayed 'clean', then got more lucrative jobs from private sectors... \n\nAnd after almost two decades as being a soldier, I get some reputation which prove to be usefully - being well-mannered, but not arrogant, cheerful and joyful, open for jokes but reliable, precise and up to the job for which I said I am. If I am not for some job, I will honestly said that I am not, and somehow, and contradictory, that give me more chance and opportunity. \n\nWhat is also become part of my 'trade' is that my men is my first responsibility and I did share everything with them - good and bad. That is why in more than few occasions, we stayed together for the worst and survive because of unity. It is not meme - if you care for your fellow soldiers, and he will take care and risk and for you, no matter what.\n\nSo, when there was 'need' for experience active soldier, but not formally part of any military and without stain - I got my first job as 'auxiliary' (i.e. formally 'security advisor') for one UN organization... \n\nWhat was certainly helpful is that my country of origin was/is neutral and with strong indigenous army and armament. For jobs in Africa it was most helpful, I must admit. If you are Russian or American, or from some ex-colonial powers - well, one can forget for 'high salary' in service of many governments. Except in the countries that are heavily involved with country of your origin - for example, being British in Kuwait is OK, but it is not in Sudan... etc.  \n\nThat condition ('no stain') is very important for 'international' kind of jobs (UN, OSCE... etc.). I know few very good guys, which have been unfortunate to be on the wrong place in the wrong time. Which simple 'mark' them - so no one want them for job, for 'political' i.e. bad PR/publicity reason. So, they persuade their career as 'soldier of fortune', which means, that they are always in the 'gray zone' - depending on the point of view, they may become treated as criminals or even worse. ""&gt; They don't do responses like that. \n\nNope, it is true. But, Putin is somehow more forgiving kind of person, than it is common for Russians. Russian was known as they never, ever forgive blood or offense of their own. One thing, on which everyone was assured that may expect is revenge. With Putin that is not a case.  \n\nIt is fine line between being understandably cautious and loosing opportunity because of being to cautious. Second one, if become to often, may become source of rumors and bad reputation for leader of his format. And thus also decrease chance for his country to prosper and avoid conflicts. Putin need badly to work on his 'soft' reputation, IMHO. ""Well, from that kind of perspective, Israel's possession of nuclear weapons is almost bad as it is for Iran. \n\nBecause, after horrors of Holocaust, the Jewish / Israel nation, come to conclusion, that only brutal force is what will protect them from being destroyed and thus they (Israeli) are ready and acting to destroy anyone who is suspect as possible 'destroyer'. Also, many have tendentious of forgiveness for Israeli conducts and deeds - can you imagine what will be EU reaction if any other country act in this way? What is much worse, is Israel own belief, that world betrayed them and that they now have full right to be free of judgments for their wrongdoings - if someone dare to say that this is not rightness, one will be accused of antisemitism. \n\nThat said, nations can get and develop psychological features like individuals - thus Israel show full symptoms of one being paranoiac. So, their narrative for me are more reliable as showcase of these symptoms, than as true argument for judgment or discussion for Israel's actions. \n\nThus, for me, Israels is also unreliable as state or nation in possession of nuclear weapon, as any other similar nation - feeling wounded, maltreated, victim of prejudice, discrimination and witnessed prosecution to the extent of extermination. \n\nBecause of their separate interests, Israel is lead, poked and pushed by the US, to become factor of instability and menace of the Middle East - not shining example of peaceful humanitarian country/state of nation which refuse to become monster instead of monster that almost extinguish them, which will more logical. But somehow Israel almost adopt the same rhetoric as of the former Nazis, as their own against Palestinian. ""True. Still, I somehow believe that Putin's wish, not to be like Yeltsin or any other former notorious leader, also may become his weakness in dealing with the NATO and the US - if he continues to show emotion and restrain, it will assure them that he (thus Russia) is instead of cautiousness, simple hiding true weakness. \n\nAnd thus see chance and opportunity for something foolish like real attack on Russia or simple push one step to far which will bring us to war. Us, not them.\n\nHe must show and define where are the red lines - today no one knows where they are for Russia, so they are pushing as much as they can, waiting for the reaction and there is none.""Doesn't mention HTS, and do you have a link to any pics/video?""Can you link to it? I'm not seeing it.""I think he is referring to the bombardments that both sides occasionally do. ""While interesting, its not really related to the SCW. ""Anyone know if Jaish al-Ahrar has left JWT? Odd to see them posting this and not JWT account.""HTS has rejected it but were they excluded in the original deal? ""He's clearly talking about armed groups within the war, and not civilians. ""Ahh, yes all the talk of HTS disbanding or being removed. I have to read up a bit more on the deal, thanks.""This seems like straight up bullshit :/\nKhashoggi was never as relevant as people put him out to be, now if we were talking about Adnan Khashoggi, I'd believe that :|""I think you're overestimating how malicious/irrational he is, killing political dissidents inside your consulate is a one shot thing, you do it once, you can't do it again, Al faqih and Mas'ari are unharmed, Adnan (not  a dissident but has very sensitive info) died naturally in 2017, even ghanem al dosssari is unharmed and they're ten times more aggressive than what Khashoggi ever was, what mbs is doing in Saudi Arabia doesn't seem like the actions of someone who wings it, so I highly doubt the movie plot of \"cut him to pieces and bring him to me\". \n\nVery good chance we'll see a conclusion to this story in the next few days, but by then I don't think this board will care past the early panic. ""Dude, the body hasn't been found yet, the Turkish police searched the consulate, said \"they'll give a statement soon\".\n\nIt doesn't make sense, if he's faux opposition he wouldn't be harmed, if he was real opposition then he would be a new entry in a list of much more aggressive voices (some dating back to 1991) that are still around.\n\nRemember that the turks and Saudis aren't on the best terms right now, Khashoggi was on the Turkish side of the fence.

It revealed the fallacy of the opposition and contrasts with the overly rosy portrayal they enjoyed in the media throughout 2011-2012.\n\nBesides, a court case does not mean that the factual backdrop of the matter is settled - this is especially the case when you have a statement of claim that obviously would only be adducing the evidence to advance the theory of the case they want to present. Much of the support for the theory relies largely on the documents and evidence presented by one defector - you are probably going to say that is good enough, but that's a hardly sufficient to satisfy the burden of proof unless you already subscribed to the theory.\n\n No one's disputing that the media center got attacked by the SAA, but the theory is that she was singled out for special attention - that flies in the face of how this war has been fought, and certainly how most journalists have been killed in this war. She may have been a recognized journalist, but she still wasn't anyone pivotal, no matter what you believe. ""The rebels are lucky this is happening at all""&gt;Can anyone link the list of Wagner mercs killed in DeZ, that was circulating on the internet at the time?\n\nThose reports vary wildly.

""In Russian and some other Slavic speaking military, artillery 'divi**z**ion' (not a 'divi**s**ion') is basic (self-sustained) battalion size formation in artillery and aviation. Self-sustained, means that like battalion, have all means neceseary for conduticng complex tactical  tasks. \n\nOne artillery (rocket) 'divizion' will have 2-4 rocket battery (company), command company, radar-observation company, logistic company... etc. - around 500-1000 soldiers and specialist. \n\nSo, here we have 3 'divizion', each with 2 battery of S-300, each S-300 battery with 4x launchers and supporting equipment and least one battery of Pantsir-S and/or Tor-M. \n\nBasically those 3 'divizion' are forming air-defense unit size of independent regiment.

""Video link?""Bashar al Assad is no more just 'son of Hafez' and 'chosen' by Ba'ath strongmen as successor. Instead, he is now a 'savior' and of them and their Syria, thus true and undisputed leader of Syria. What ever one may think about him - in any and free election he will win by clear margins.\n\nWe are looking in birth of new Syria in which he wants to include as many Syrian as it is possible. And by this amnesty thru serving on the front line - he gives a chance to all those categories, to wash their hands and become part of this new Syria. So, if they do not take this chance with Assad's offer for amnesty, along with deserters and dodgers, they all may become true apatrides, almost like Kurds.\n\nIt also has to be said, that Putin's gamble thus paid of - hardliners thought that they (Russia) need to send massive land force instead of just tiny RuAF detachment. Putin argument was, that Syrian (and Assad) must be the one that will have to do the all hard work, thus creating own feeling of achievement, individually and collectively - because their blood will be spilled, and they are those who will recaptured their own country, and thus they will be true winner. And true allay to Russia.\n\nLet as look at situation in Syria:        \nThere is no more reliable opposition movement, rebellion as armed insurgency, can not withstand fight with SAA without being protected by presence of occupying foreign troops (the US in Rojava and Turkey in Idlib). Simple flaw of foreign 'volunteers', cash and weapons is no more enough against SAA. That expose insurgence to be or 'just collaborator' or 'traitor'. \n\nThe US did have two choices:      \nFirst, to silently withdraw and second, to give a chance to military option. Trump 'wash his hand' politically by giving opportunity (and responsibility) to the US Military with 'open hands' on Syria, which they did militarily flawlessly, but without political solution. So, one thing was withdrawing 'few' clandestine SF operatives, and totally different is this strong and open military presence. \n\nSo, in the foreseeing future (maybe decades) we will see one third of Syria occupied by the US and NATO (Turkey) and rise of Bashar al Assad as true and undisputed leader in the rest of Syria. As for the Russian position in Syria, they are no more just 'supporter of regime' as their proxy in global struggle, but trusted allay which did not abandon them and help them (more important!), thus help Syrian to achieve victory. So this alliance is not forged only by cash and weapons, but thru sharing and blood. ""Nope, but this is no more relevant - if ever  was...""As I have written in another post:      \n\"*The US did have two choices: First, to silently withdraw and second, to give a chance to military option.

So, one thing was withdrawing 'few' clandestine SF operatives, and totally different is this strong and open military presence.*\" \n\nAs we all know, the US have tendencies to be stubborn and rise stakes in face of possible retreat or withdraw (what can be recognized as defeat). Thus, and with military presence in Syria.\n\nSo, with this move, Trump again 'wash his hand' politically, by shifting decision for this prolonged US presence in Syria from him (and Pentagon), to Congress. \n\nAs this US presence may become truly 'prolonged' (for a few or even more decades), thus become certainly very costly, and also at some point and bloodied - Trump and Pentagon needs (and not just politically), united Congress behind that decision. \n\nAs the alternative of prolonged presence, is the US withdraw (seen as defeat), I do believe that the Congress will conclude and make decision to invest in the US presence and in forming alternative state-like-entity to Assad's Syria. \n\nThat said, I do not believe that they will support new Kurdish entity like KRG in Iraq, but instead they will revival idea of independent multinational Northern Syria.\n""&gt;They have zero influence.

The U.S. supplied their entire war effort, and Assad treated the Kurdish elements poorly pre-war.  Why would the Kurds go back to being unarmed and poorly treated?\n\nEdit:  The U.S. does tell Turkey what to do sometimes.  Turkey did attack Manbij from Jarabulus during the original ES operation.  The U.S. put troops on the river between those towns (forget the name) and they immediately stopped, permanently.  Is that not influence?""It's just logical in this case.  SDF rebels are \"better\" than FSA and jihadists.  They've even worked together.""They won't even challenge Turkey in Idlib.  What makes you think they'll challenge the U.S. afterwards?""Doesn't matter in this context.  They are an armed organization in defiance of Assad rule.  That's a textbook definition for being rebels.""Well, they (Israel) did have better deal than I ever have imagined or even I was ready to believe that it is possible. I do must apologize again to many users here for my stubborn stance. \n\nSo, they had deal and then they screwed. Israels blame game is basically useless, because it was not one isolated incident, but accordingly to RuMoD, just a one drop too much. Or better to say, splash that sunk this deal. \n\nAnother thing, this deal - it was Putin decision, which did have serious opposition in his 'inner circle', or better to say, coalition behind him.\n\nAs for the Putin, I am sure that he is even now ready for talks, but Russian (or better to say his political companion) are not. Obviously, Putin still believe that he has 'partners' in the West democracies, but more and more of his Russian political allay believe that this is his dangerous self-deception. \n\nThat Russia have to act preemptively, because they are nowhere near to strength of former USSR (estimation is that Russian is at 10% or even less military capability comparing to USSR). \n\nThus, they do not have rooms for (more) concession or compromises, because they are surrounded and military overpowered by the US - the only thing which is keeping Russia afloat is nuclear deterrent and to the same point, shier size. \n\nSo, they (hardliners) believe that it was mistake, allowing the US/SDF to take all North (they demanded sending Russian troops to help to retake Deir Ez-Zor and actively pursuit ISIL across Euphrates). And on top of that, continuing to having deal with Israel (or any new deal), they (Russia) is risking to lose more than and Iran and Syria.\n\t\nI do believe that Netanyahu maybe know that, but for sure he will try to talk, what else he can do? If there happen to be in the future one more incident or incident were SyADF or RuADF engage and shoot down Israeli jet(s), this will be the end of his (Netanyahu) political career. \n\nHe will be then remembered as politician which managed to screw up deals and relation with Russia. That, regarding the future of Israel, even regarding Israel survival, is an unforgivable mistake for any politician.

So it is 6 '*battery*' with 6x4=24 launchers or 3 '*divizion*' with 3x8=24 launchers. \n\nBut, that said, there are possible more added units: At least one Command company added to each division, one Regimental battalion sized Radar/observation/command unit with Early warning capability, logistic battalion, security... etc. \n\nAnd also (almost forget) there will be at least one or more 'divizion' sized unit of medium to short rocket/artillery (i.e made of 'Tor', 'Pantsir'... etc.) ""&gt;Those kids are probably brainwashed tbh, they'll never be normal\n\nBrainwashing can be undone, especially in children.

Russia or Syria? Nope, only the US.      \n- \"*and perfectly fine with integrating into Syria*\" - that presume that Syria is willing to integrate 'Rojava' (assuming large autonomy or even federalization) - what if the Syrian (Assad or not) do not want this?     \n\nFor the sake of argument, let's say 'Rojava' want and Syria want - is this possible? Nope, because of the US - which may let Turkey in, in the Kurdish part and more directly control rest with Arab tribes from belt around Euphrates. \n\nSo, it is not matter, what Rojava or Syria want or do not want, but what will the US allow. Thus partner for hypothetical talks of Rojava 'reintegration' for Syria is not 'Rojava', but the US. And if they will talk with the US, they will talk about Syrian territory, not about how to '*integrate 'Rojava*'      \n\nEDIT:  /Remarks about KRG (Iraq) and Rojava (Syria)\n\nAlthough both entity is possible because of the US alliance, they are different in the nature, but also with different roles in the US plans, but with the same goal - confront Iran's and Russia's influence and presence in those two countries, on ME and globally. \n\nSo, this two entities will exist and thus, be supported only if they support the US goals and will be abandoned if they are not or their action will jeopardize those goals (like self-proclaimed independence by KRG).""&gt; I don't think anyone here can guess what's on Assad's mind\n\nVery true. There is some analysis of Assad and his evolution during this war. In short, from 'unwilling' and not planed successor (death of his brother), to real leader, with true and undisputed support by the Syrian people. \n\nThat said, he was more pro-Western than pro-Russian or pro-Iranian before the Arab springs, protests and civil war. His position was weak, and he did heavily dependent on support by the Ba'ath 'strongmen'.\n\nBut as result of the current outcome of the war, support by the Iran and Russian, he become symbol of victory and resistance to what he was confronted with: Rebellion, the US/NATO, the Israel, the Gulf monarchies, Jihadists (ISIL, Al-Qaeda... etc.). And what is more important  - he gained this as true personal support to him, by the majority of the Syrian! Which neither of his opponent or predecessors did have or do have.\n\nInterestingly, that support does not include rest of his family and (what is more important), rest of his government. And that also give him possibility to reshape and Syria and Governments as he needs and are pleased.\n\nBasically, he actually has more power in his hands than his father did ever have! Will he be able (be capable) to use that powers and in which direction, is about to be seen.  ""Depend on the US plans lonely.""- Well, first of all there is not '3 million' in Idlib - that population is heavily depleted by emigration and inner migration.        \n\n- Second, FSA (now NLA) is nowhere near 2/3 of the rebels' strength in Idlib - at most one third to one quarter.     \n\n- Third, Turkey is not interested in keeping 'peace' but more in 'keeping territory', in expansion manner which was seen in Cyprus.    \n\n- Fourth, the US does not really support YPG, but at first place oppose Russia, Iran and Assad, and because of that, they support the YPG and Rojava... etc. \n\nIn short, simplified view of BBC and Western MSM, prepared Western public as preparedness for all possible outcome, including and the Western intervention on basis of humanitarian catastrophe...\n\n""&gt; The Turks are likely going to hit Rojava but will they do so alone or with SAA support? \n\nNope, not even a possibility - Turkey's first goal is expansion and annexation - the YPG/PKK and SCW are just convenient excuse. Secondary Turkey's goal is plans of Muslim Brotherhood, which main exponent is Turkey. \n\nAs for the Rojava, all depends on the US and their relation with Iran and Russia. Thus, in foreseeable future, Rojava is 'safe' from Turkey and SAA - only in case of some 'new deal' between Russia and the US (highly unlikely) or cold war becoming 'hot' (not highly unlikely, but still unlikely), Rojava may become jeopardized. \n\nThat all said, Rojava will most likely never become truly independent. There is also possibility, that the Kurds will have to abandon YPG as formation in that new entity, Northern Syria and become just part in  armed force of this proto-state.""&gt; when you scratch the surface, there are tons of different interests and motives underneath, even though taken actions are in a similar manner.\n\nTrue, if this '*different interests and motives underneath*' are primary motivation for the Turkey's involvement. \n\nBut, IMHO, it is not - most people see Turkey's action as result of Erdogan coming in power, but he is just fallowing agenda made much earlier - this are goals drawn in the first years of modern Turkey (after the First WW). \n\nErdogan just use support of Muslim Brotherhood, YPG/PKK 'menace' and insurgence and SCW (as convenient excuse) to fulfill those old and true Turkish goals and by this ensure his power.\n\nThat said, Turkey do not want 'whole' Idlib, but what they see as goals is those territories which was taken from them by creation of Syria and Iraq. Of course, if they can keep whole Idlib under the controls in foreseen future - why not?""RBSS isn't pro-IS, such an organization wouldn't have been created if it was, members were even hunted by the State. At the same time, they aren't also anti-YPG/J or anti-Kurd, organizations and people can be against both, RBSS has always been pro-rebel.

the opening of the Idlib fronts for the camp of Rikban\n\n\nThe leader of the \"Sham Liberation Organization\", Abu Malik Tali, called for the opening of the forces against the Syrian regime in Idlib, a \"victory\" for the camp that is besieged on the Syrian-Jordanian border.\n\nHe criticized the leadership through his account in \"Telgram\" today, Saturday, October 13, the process of withdrawing heavy weapons from the buffer zone in Idlib, under the agreement signed between Russia and Turkey in Sochi.\n\n\"This talk is directed at each faction leader or military axis, you must support your brothers in your strongholds ... Do not say that we do not deal with reactions, the origin of the victory in our religion based on the reaction according to ability and God knows your situation.\"\n\nSince the closure of the port to Jordan under pressure from Russia and the closure of the conscience road by the Assad forces, the camp has been under siege since June. It has been suffering from the closure of UNICEF for weeks, without explaining the reasons.\n\nThe military factions in Idlib, including the \"liberation of the Levant\" pulled out, in the past few days, heavy weapons from the fronts with the forces of Assad in the vicinity of Idlib.\n\nThe \"Liberation of the Sham\" did not give an official position of the Sochi agreement until today, according to what opposition sources said to the grapes of my country, it implicitly agreed to the agreement undeclared, against the background of the division of her home.\n\nJamal Zinia, nicknamed \"Abu Malik Tali\", one of the leading leaders in the \"Liberation of the Sham\" and the Amir of the \"Nasra Front\" in the Western pen, until he moved to the province of Idlib, under the recent agreement between \"Hezbollah\" and \" , Last August.\n\nThe leader of the hardline movement in the \"Liberation of the Sham\", rejecting the Turkish-Russian agreement, along with the leaders \"Abu al-Fath al-Farghali\" and \"Abu al-Iqazan of Egypt\".""And I hope they continue to do so in order to improve on police groups. That way they can model for the rest of Rojava and Syria on how to lead peacefully and not forcefully. It is a concept that is hard in the Middle East. We must have patience and guidance.""I don't think there is a deal either. However I do think that the two are connected in Erdogan's mind and that he is using the opportunity to pressure the White House. He wasn't in a position to do this effectively when the pastor-sanction row was a roadblock to dialogue.""Any idea what [patch this is](https://i.imgur.com/nowMbsh.jpg)?""&gt; What do you think the SSNP's role in this is?\n\nMinor. They are secular, pan-Arabic like it is Ba'ath, but as first and foremost, and above all, they are pan-Syrian nationalist. Meaning, Syrian people are Syrian for them, no matter what religion is their background, as long as they are Syrian. So, if the Assad is on that secular path of uniting Syria, they are fine with him and of course he can use them - especially against all foreign or religious threats to Syria. \n\nThere are some rumors about their political strength (i.e. \"The SSNP is now Syria's largest party after the ruling Ba'ath\"), because of their register member (between 100-120.000). \n\nWell, that is simple overestimated - in Syrian Parliament out of 250 seats, they have 7. So, it is less than 4% and that is somehow their real strength. Or better to say true distribution of those ultra nationalists a like, amongst voters and in any other country - for example in the West and or the East - in any country, as matter of fact. \n\nOf course their influence may naturally rise due the actual threats and pressure by other nationalist and fundamentalist (Israel, Turkey, Saudis, Kurds... etc.) or foreign 'invaders' on Syria, like the US, Turkey, Israel... etc, but I truly do not believe that they can be real threat to Assad.\n\n\n""OK, I do respect your opinion - we can agree that we disagree LoL\n\n&gt; The main goal the US has now is to make sure it's oil stays safe\n\nWell, I do believe that oil role is little overestimated today - it is nowhere near situation like it was in '70s. As matter of fact the US/Canada have proven reserve for about century to come. At present day, the US 'Net imports' for oil is just 3,77% !!! And with higher price, that can be even lower...            \nhttps://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=727&amp;t=6\n    \nSecond, oil and gas reserve in Syria are small - actually Syria was always been more like importer than exporter. People have prejudice, like this is Arab desert country, so there must be a lot of oil. Well, there is not. \n\nProblem with Iranian oil is that Iran can lower oil price even more, and also, that they together with Qatar and Russia can jeopardize gas market in the EU - jeopardize for the UK and new US ambition of selling gas to EU. Russia do not have problem with that because they have new and the largest market for oil and Gas in the world - China. And they are also coming on big doors and in India with Iran. And that is half of Worlds population... \n\nIt this game, Syria is truly insignificant. The only Syrian importance are geopolitics position and the fact, that Arab spring revolution did not go as planed - Assad survive and Russians are back.\n""Well, I do hope that we will remember this conversation in 2029 - things then will be much clearer LoL""&gt; Are you implying that Assad doesn't want to take back his northern territories despite having the intention to do so? Syrians also want Rojava to integrate into Syria and, as of right now, want unity more than anything.\n\nNo, no... you got me wrong: Of course he wants, but without any special rights for the Kurds or without any kind of autonomy or federalization. They (Assad and his circle) are now more like 'all or nothing'. They do believe that in time they will regain whole Syria without any concession or compromises to give or make.\n\n&gt; We don't even know if the US even has an endgame. \n\nNope, as for the US military, they achieved their goals, and positioned forces and control territory in preparedness for eventual war.\nBut, what is political purpose or endgame - that is little bit like confused, but all are agreed that they have to counter Iran and Russia LoL \n\n&gt; Furthermore, you exclude Iran and Russia in your analysis and they are bigger influences in this conflict than the US and Turkey.\n\nNope, but they are ones that are actually calming down this war and are pro reunification of Syria. Which is natural, because Syria is their allay. That said, their influence is significant, but can not compare with combined might of the US, NATO, Turkey, Saudi Arabia... etc. In that constellation of conflicted interests, they achieved surprising and astonishing result: Assad did survive so far and rebellion is almost distinguished - at least near Damascus and Russian bases...""&gt; Decentralisation, if applied responsibly to the Syrian context, could resolve the Kurdish question and help put the country on the path to peace.\n\nMaybe, but it looks like that Syrian Government abandoned this idea - in favor for patients and force, they believe that in time, they will succeed reunifying Syria without need for concession or compromises.\n\n""FWIW, that's actually a Maxxpro MRAP, and would be the second one lost by the SDF this week.""&gt; Then you agree that the US has no reason to be in Syria and is just doing so to make sure that area of the world is under US influence?\n\nOf course - it is simple part of global real life 'Command &amp; Conqueror:Russia Alert' game, or better to say, but like in chess play, we are still in stage of endless opening, with just few pawn ready for exchange. But, it is just matter of time when one of the player will take a more aggressive or bold move...\n\nIn this global game as you know, there is just a few sea and land straits. The US, Russia, China... etc. all are in race and struggle to maintain controls or to conquer those passages for the sea, air or land routes.\n\nIf some small countries or big, but weak are on that route, they are becoming pray like Panama, for example. Well, this is the case and with Syria - simple they are on fine, even great place for trade/communication/exchange, but also and in bad place, because of those strategic and military concerns. \n""&gt;  These interests are contradictory and often the US, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia don't get along because of that.\n\nTrue, and as you wrote \"*Iran, Russia, and Syria all share the same interests which is to make sure that Syria is unified*\", that is why their limited, but concentrated and coordinated effort do give results. ""&gt; But Assad has stated that he's willing to federalize Syria. This isn't a concession for Rojava but a concession for Syrians.\n\nThat is before he was wining, I believe. Also, and the Russian (Lavrov's speech days ago) are behind this new Syrian course for no political changes (thus no needs for new constitutional parliament) and as far they are concern, Assad and Syrian government is more than enough legitimate - one may oppose that, but peacefully and 'wait for election' or be threaded as terrorist.  ""&gt; They have the capability to do wonders and most of the population supports them.\n\nWell, I can not deny or confirm this, but I do believe that Assad do have enough influence and power to restrain or even diminish any threat to his rule.""How much electricity was there on a daily basis in Ghouta?""Channel I'm in which posted the video a few days ago said it was in al-Sousa.""Thanks, primarily made up of YPG/J or other groups as well?""Translated using Google Translate without editing:\n\nState of Sham\n# Pond\nTargeting Hummer and motorcycle PKK apostates improvised explosive device north of the town of # hybrid, resulting in the destruction and seriously injured on board, we ask God to accelerate their destruction.\n\n#\u0639\u0627\u062c\u0644\n\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0629 #\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0645\n#\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0643\u0629\n\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0647\u062f\u0627\u0641 \u0647\u0645\u0631 \u0648\u062f\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0629 \u0646\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644PKK \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u062a\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0639\u0628\u0648\u0629 \u0646\u0627\u0633\u0641\u0629 \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u0644\u062f\u0629 #\u0647\u062c\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0633\u0641\u0631 \u0639\u0646 \u062a\u062f\u0645\u064a\u0631\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0648\u0625\u0635\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u062a\u0646\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u062c\u0631\u0648\u062d \u0628\u0644\u064a\u063a\u0629\u060c \u0646\u0633\u0623\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0639\u062c\u0651\u0644 \u0628\u0647\u0644\u0627\u0643\u0647\u0645.""Every bit counts.""Mods, im trying to add a flair from Mobile but cant!""Thought every post here had to have a flair""Nice, tnx""Between heterosexual men, only because of friendship is. \n\nI am from brazil.

I work with people displaced by ISIS and the majority of children did not go to school, because the curriculum changed from one focused on actual education to religious education. Most children have spent several years out of school until their area is re-taken.""It is not clear picture, but it looks like new AK-12 (not an AK-74M or AK-107 series). \n\nThen, there is possibility that this is from field-test batch of AK-12/'200' prototype (which is canceled), and instead RuMoD choose AK-12/'400' base prototype for production - which is more closer (less radical) to AK-74M/107 family.\n\nAnd finally, that just maybe some third party or after-market stock.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK-12""&gt; Federal districts would have more responsibilities than they do now. They would be comparable to Swiss cantons and FOCJs than centralized governorates.\n\nThere is only one region identifiable for federalization or broader autonomy, and that is North part (original territory of Rojava) of SDF held territory. For all other - I really do not seen any benefits.\n\n&gt; They would be comparable to Swiss cantons and FOCJs than centralized governorates.\n\nSwiss cantons have long history of independents after which they form today known 'union'. In the Syrian case there is no such historical reasons or demographic, IMHO.\n\nAnother example is Bosnia and Herzogovina, which do have cantons, but which was made after achieved truce and are totally failed to address any ethnicity or land-owners right issue - except to recognize what was war-party status (possessed territory) at the end of war.   \n\n&gt; Governorates aren't even close to decentralization.\n\nDepending on the given authority, i.e. decentralization. \n\nSo, in short - my opinion is that if there have to be any decentralization (I do not see why - Syria is small country, anyway), then the base for this decentralization have to be administrative and by population density, not by the ethnicity or cultural diversity. They are almost all Arabs (with different religion), so the best way is true democratization, strong executive/presidential type (like France or Russia or the US) with new more secular constitutions - i.e have less influenced by the Sharia law and Sunni Islamic tradition.  \n""The YPG is taking minimal casulties during these operations.""&gt; It may be the AK74M3 Upgrade with modern parts\n\nThose modern parts seem to be from AK-12 standard production version (i.e. based on '400' prototype) - it is designed to be interchangeable with earlier models AK-74/107 and is in serial production, delivered to Russian Army. This prototypes ('200' and '400') was also distributed to some Russian units last year for field-test evaluation:     \n\nhttps://www.ar15.com/forums/equipment-exchange/Russian-AK74M3-AK74M-Modernization-Ratnik-New-AK-12-parts/123-1690834/\n\nPicture is not clean enough, so it is not visible are there any Picatinny rail and what is position of the rear sights - it is unique for the AK-12 to be closer to the butt-stock, not in middle as it was with other, older models...""Is the problem with the General?

This way they simplified and shorten chain of integration, thus make system more robust to EW and other means of SEAD.\n\nSyrian obviously use some sets of PMU codes and frequencies (in another word, 'exports' one) for the rest of their systems (radars, BUK/KUB, Pantsir... etc), which means, that if 'someone' get familiar with them, can not use them in SEAD operations against those integrated in Russian air defense.\n\nAll S-300 system are 'hard-wired' to specific network - that is reason why the US did not have any advantages from Ukrainian and Belorussian acquired systems, until they received from Russia (on Yeltsin order in 1995) fully functional missile, codes, manuals and blueprints - and all translated in English LoL \n\nSo, that is why (along this mentioned upgrades) they also are changing and *letters* from Cyrillic to Arabic, including numerical ones. Thus, familiarization and training will be much faster.\n\nIn short, Russia obviously is 'here to stay' for many decades to come, and thus they will fully integrate Syrian AD like this is doing for example, in case of the US and let's say, UK. \n""This. \n\nAnd also will upgrade it in to the PM-2 standard to interconnect with rest of equipment, which are obviously of newer generation. \n\nThey (Russian) were pretty clear about this (in that statement), but as you know, like in old tail 'The Fox and the Grapes', hater needs to find adequate excuse or narrative against Russian - thus proving themselves as true patriot and why they are Russophobe...

Federalized state can be also authoritarian, even dictatorships, as those you calls 'unitary'.\n\nThat said, lack of efficiency may bring more problem and corruptions which usually fallow federalization then it is case with those unitary ones.

I do not think so. \n\nEven and if that is maybe estimated summary number for all parties against ISIL and rebels in past three years. And even then, it is huge. \n\nMy estimation (can not document, have no source, just a hunch...)&gt;     \n\n- If we estimate that total numbers of casualties is around half million and that 70-90 percent was civilian (due to the nature of modern warfare and nature of Syrian Civil War) - all sides suffered from 50.000-150.000. Let's say it is 100.000. \n\n- Assumed ration is 2:1 - so, that will bring SAA and allies to the numbers of casualties about 30.000+ and ISIL+rebels to around 60-70.000 during this war. \n\n- As this war is ongoing for seven years, and Russian intervention is for around 3 years - that gives number of about 30-40.000 fighters from ISIL+rebels in past 3 years. \n\n- If the US/Coalition and SDF are behind at least 1/4 of these casualties (to ISIL), this leave 25-30.000 for SAA/RuAF/Militia/IRGC. \n\n- And if the RuAF is responsible for max. quarter of these deaths, that is around 7-8.000... As they were far more precise than rest of alliance - I will estimate civilian deaths by the RuAF at around 1.000...\n\nAs he (General Shoygu) also mentioned settlements and territories - it was certainly not done by the RuAF. Especially not 95% - We all know that around one third of Syrian territory is still unavailable to Assad and SAA. But, if he included and those territories captured by the SDF/US, thus liberated from ISIL, then this account is somehow correct, but not as result of Russian sole actions.\n""I just tried making it more similar to the \"old reddit\" appearance.

Let's say 40K by now. \n\nAnd that number is questionable - it means 30-40 per day, each day. But, if that number of sorties include and transport, reconnaissance, patrol flight... then it can have sense.\n\nAnyway, that numbers are about 'killed' fighters from ISIL and rebels - one may expect that number of wounded is at lest 3-4 time or even more bigger.\n\n&gt; whatever your opinion is about RuAF killing skills they can't be that low\n\nActually, it is (my estimation) rather high and surprising numbers - everyone agreed that they (RuAF) are astonishingly precise with their on-board guiding system. \n\nFor example, the US is still at around 4 tones of air-borne ammo per kills and around 4,000 infantry bullets per kill - which is great improvement from Vietnam, almost 4:1.\n\n\n/Remarks about difference - war-games and real world    \n\nDuring their service and war, the most of the soldiers did not kill or even shot at anyone. As a matter of fact - average units have only 2-3% of soldiers that aim at enemy and shot - 70-90% shot in some direction without aiming, and rest... well, they hide. \n\nThat is why is SFO so deadly - you can expect from this kind of units to have ratio over 99% for aim-and-shot-to-kill - and that is why we calculate, that effectiveness of SF in combat is 20:1 or more, comparing to average unit. When veteran and experience unit, reach 10% or more percent of aim-and-shot-to-kill, that unit is becoming battle hardened and utterly efficient...\n\nAlso, any loses above 2-3% per fight is usually enough to make average units sway in their position, and as loses rise - they retreat if they can. With 10% loses in fight unit is \"decimated\", and inexperienced non-veteran units are usually disbanded and personnel spread in to the other units. \n\nThat said, experienced, veteran or highly motivated units (like some ISIL units showed) can sustain and higher loses and still continue to advance or defend their position. That needs time and luck or indoctrination, but in case of indoctrination and motivated ferocity, that not replace combat skills. Although can rise fear in your opponents. Like in fist-fighting, ferocity without skills, usually means ones defeat.""&gt; RuAF keeps their planes generally out in the open, even in the artic. \n\nThere are shelters, but usually not that close to the runaway, they are well camouflaged, so most are not 'seen' on satellite pictures or during air-reconnaissance. If one wants the real data, he must rely on on-site HumInt, which is notoriously difficult in Russian case (wandering around the Russian secret military complex or warehouse LoL).\n\nFor example, some 'abandoned' Russian air field are not abandoned at all - they are usually near heavily masked warehouse with brand-new and battle ready air-frames, which will be used in case of war. \n\nThat is why expert have true doubts of estimated or published numbers for battle ready worthy air-frames and units of Russia.""Who by whom?

We just have to be patient. \n\nIMHO, nope. *We* (the Westerners) are on borrowed time. Especially White and Christian ones. And in just few decades, we will collectively fall, first economically, then militarily. \n\nMy point of view:      \nNot so long ago, population on the West was about third to quarter of all humanity (19-20th century). During the 20th century, our societies becomes smaller and smaller comparing to the Third world. For example: Back in the '50s, the US have by numbers, around half population as the India did have or one third as China did have. Now this ratio is 4:1. \n\nOr the UK&gt; Ratio vs. India was 6:1 in '50s, and now is less the 20:1... Just with India.\n\nLook at these maps:     \nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/2017_world_map%2C_median_age_by_country.svg/1280px-2017_world_map%2C_median_age_by_country.svg.png      \nand this one      \nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/1_world_map_2010-2015_population_increase_rate_by_country.svg/1280px-1_world_map_2010-2015_population_increase_rate_by_country.svg.png      \nor this one     \nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Countries_by_Birth_Rate_in_2014.svg/1280px-Countries_by_Birth_Rate_in_2014.svg.png\n\nThis one is even more telling:      \nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/World_population_percentage.png\n\nWe, the Westerner, are just around 10% of the whole Word population today, and that percentage decline fast. Fallowing with economical strength, and at the end and militarily. What do you think - how will India or China treat the US or Russia or UK or France in just for a half century in the future? It is not the faraway - for those now in twenties-thirties, this is time when their grandsons and granddaughters will be teenagers. What World will they inherit? \n\nConclusion - we are destined to die out. ""*Modern 'Political Islam' throughout the ME* is ultra conservative, comparing to how it was the in the times of their grandfathers. Also, more aggressive and less tolerant than it was. \n\nThis reminds me on Christianity in the age of Crusaders and few centuries after with Puritans... etc. - it is the same kind of attitude in Political Islam throughout the ME today.\n\nAnd the outcome will not be good one for anyone.""I'm really not too sure, haven't heard much of that alliance since it was announced.

The incident comes two weeks after a similar incident between the movement of Nur al-Din al-Zanki and the Liberation of the Sham.\n\nIn every confrontation, civilians are killed, the last of which was in the town of Kfarhalb in the western part of Aleppo, against the backdrop of clashes between residential neighborhoods.\n\nThe confrontations between the factions coincide with a state of security chaos experienced by Idlib, killing dozens of civilians and military.\n\nThe \"Liberation of the Sham\" recently accused the cells of organizing the \"Islamic State\" to stand behind the state of chaos, and said it is working to eliminate them in several areas Idlib and countryside.\n\nThe \"Liberation of the Sham\" has entered into confrontations with the other factions operating in Idlib, most notably the recent fighting with the \"Syrian Liberation Front\", preceded by fighting with the movement \"Ahrar Sham Islamic\".""Translated using Google Translate without editing:\n\n****\n\nA tragic humanitarian situation in the camp \"You are not alone\" north of Idlib\n\nThousands of displaced people are living in tragic conditions in the camp of \"Not alone\" near the village of Kafrlusin, north of Idlib, especially as the harsh winter approaches, despite the appeals of displaced people living in the camp.\n\nThe camp includes some 1,200 families forcibly displaced from central Syria and south of Damascus. It is divided into four sections of the northern Homs rural villages, a gathering of the people of al-Ghouta, a group of displaced people from Daraa and a sector of the displaced from the southern countryside of Idlib.\n\nAnd every sector suffers from lack and lack of basic life matters Some require insulation to cover the roofs of tents in order not to enter the water into the tents, while others complained about the lack of condoms in the floors of the sector of the abandoned shield or the drums placed under the tents.\n\nHe asked parents to provide household utensils for cooking, but the baskets distributed in the camp is very small and not enough for the smallest family in the camp and even the bread provided to the families not enough, there are very large families in the camp.\n\nThe sanitation in the camp is very bad and caused skin diseases. Parents complained about the lack of medical services or ambulances in the camp to transport patients and their ambulances in times of need, with the delay in the establishment and completion of teaching tents for young children.\n\nThere have been cases of deaths in the camp due to the spread of the epidemic hepatitis epidemic intensely in the camps of Kfralosin and the lack of services for ambulances, or special equipment for emergency cases in the camp, and there is no medical point or the area of \u200b\u200bthe camps, the nearest medical point about the region towards 10 km.\n\nLast Friday, the girl, \"Juri Adil al-Za'al,\" died of one-and-a-half-year-old Daraa, after her father tried to help her through the medical point in al-Amal camp at 11:30 pm. \"The alternates refused to give her ambulance by ambulance. What happened and talked by her father.\n\nAs winter approaches and enters, the camp needs blankets, heating materials and rain-proofing materials. To clarify the remaining families in the camp are poor families who do not have the cost of their day's worth.\n\nThe question is whether the camp-based organizations are unable to secure the camp's requirements, why they do not allow other organizations to help them meet the basic needs and the basic necessities of life for the people of the camp.\n\nSome 35,000 displaced civilians, fighters and their families left central Syria as part of an agreement to withdraw from the area, which took place between representatives of the northern Homs and Hama south, and the regime and the Russians.""Would hold some weight if they released evidence of it.""I'm with you on that, they haven't released a lot despite a lot of claims such as this from Manbij to Fallujah.""Nidal, so defacto unconfirmed.

Decision makers in the US may decide that upgrading their air fleet is a worthwhile endeavor while thinking the opposite about funding operations in Syria. ""US soldiers are still in Iraq.""It is a work in progress. Updating things in the redesign has had some unexpected results. I tried to revert the icon but the old one seems lost, so I chose something closer to what I remember. Ideally we will update it to something more neutral. ""Why not?  What is wrong with that?\n\nAre the Russia and the US allay or obliged by any pact or treaty of non-aggression or neutrality? Nope.     \nAre the US see Russia as enemy and threat? Yup.     \nAre the Russia see the US as threat. Yup.     \n\nIs anyone have illusion that between the US, Russia, China is everything 'OK'? Or we are witnessing Second Cold War, far more intense and brutal than previous one? Yup, we are. \n\nSo, why not? Let's look at just one of possible scenario&gt;   \n\n 'Somehow' the US obtained Intel info, that 'then-and-then', there will be numerous launch of drones by 'someone'. So, naturally, they (the US) dispatched ELINT craft to obtain info on Russian AD (signature, frequencies, data links, response, precision... etc.).\n\nAnd if this drone were controlled by GPS and other means (which is practically property of the US Military), then after gathered Intel, they then \"*began to be controlled from space and to prompt them to the so-called holes into which they began to penetrate, and then they were destroyed.*\u201d \n\nAre that impossible for the US Military - to track and take over the control of those drones? Nope, it is not.      \nSo, why would the US resist on opportunity to gather Intel and harass Russian air-base and air defense with convenient usage of 'someone else' drone campaign and watch the results?\n\nAfter all, is the US continuous presence in Syria just because of Iran, or because they are allayed with Russia like Assad is? Again, we are witnessing Second Cold War, far more intense and brutal than previous one, and far more closer to real conflict, than anyone else would like. Except those lunatics and warmonger, with damaged personality or brain.\n""&gt; Russia is working to protect it's interest. Not Iran's.\n\nAnd to have Iran as allay is strategic interest for Russia, even in the case of loosing influence in Syria. \n\nLet me ask you one question: Why did the Russia intervene in Syria? Because of 'fighting terrorist'? Because of air and naval base - they have Crimea and Kaliningrad, in the heart of Europe... \n\nSo, because they were *invited*. By whom - Assad or Iran? With opportunity to mess up someone interests (US-NATO-Turkey and their allay) or to 'fight terrorist'? \n\nAssad said in interview to NBC that Russia (Putin) did not want anything from him or from Syria. Why not? Because someone else (Iran) needed help and someone else was ready to pay for it (China).""But non-lethal one: \n\n*Jeux sans fronti\u00e8res*    \n\n\"Hans plays with Lotte    \nLotte plays with Jane     \nJane plays with Willi      \nWilli is happy again      \nSuki plays with Leo       \nSacha plays with Britt       \nAdolf builds a bonfire       \nEnrico plays with it\"\n\nfrom Peter Gabriel's - Games Without Frontiers   \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xZmlUV8muY""&gt; So there is a lot of strategic value to having a year-round warm water Mediterranean port in Syria for the Russians. \n\nTrue, then compare to this article&gt;       \nhttps://orientalreview.org/2016/04/11/a-caspian-canal-not-so-fast/ \n\nIt is more or less, neutral analysis.

So, this is some kind of 'resting' area, not area from which will they operate (although they can).\n\nOn the march they are protected by Tor-Morfei-Pantsir-Tunguska, which all may fire while moving, and add on that are middle range system like Kub, which needs max. 20 second to fire from on the march.\n\nSome people refer to S-400 system which is part of Khmeimim air-base defense, which is in permanent position, thus the launcher tube is mainly in erected position.

To be honest, looking thru years in the past, there is no true competent and skilled US diplomats left on the scene - they became rare and endangered species after Clinton-Bush-Obama administrations combined efforts...\n\nAnyway he was there to send one message, and which did not land well: The US (Trump) did have high hope, that after this message (hint on leaving INF Treaty), Russia will backpedal and say: \"*Oh, please, don't! For God's sake, just not that!*\"\n\nTrue is that non-existence (or respect) of INF Treaty, was started long ago, by the US administration - from Bush to Obama, but also and by Russia. So, for Russia it is nothing new, as they are already well-prepared for this scenario, by breaking of INF Treaty for many years ago. \n\nConsequences for the US, in case of leaving this treaty, will also be like removing corner stone from all other treaty with Russia, which will then been abandoned - START, Open Sky... etc. And then again, those who will lose the most - is EU members of NATO, not the US. That may result in tighter relation in NATO, but also and in separated deals with Russians - especially for those countries which are not 'true' member of the NATO - like Sweden or Finland.\n\nSo, what is alternative - i.e a modern day 'reconstructed' INF treaty? \n\nThe US (and Russia) will have to achieve a deal with China and rest of countries which possess nuclear weapons. That is practically impossible - can you imagine INF Treaty, co-signed by China, Israel, Pakistan, France, India, N. Korea... etc? In some Galaxy far, faraway... maybe.\n\nEDIT:     \nAnd then he gives this interview&gt; https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-bolton/trump-adviser-says-russia-should-get-out-of-crimea-and-eastern-ukraine-idUSKCN1N01TF What a joker!""Unfortunately nothing - still living on pension funds LoL""The US does not want to defeat ISIS. We want them to have a small presence so that we can say we are there to fight them. If we send in marines we will beat them within a month.

The DMC can't control that.

And this wouldn't be for the first time. \n\nThe US and their Coalition partners (from SAK to UK), are more worried about possibility that SAA may recapture some Syrian soil or by the presence of Shia militia (i.e. in their eyes that is the PMU), then to be worried about one non important battle in fight against ISIL. \n\nTo be honest, it seems to be true: the ISIL is about to regain few settlements and territory, but it is small set-back, thus irrelevant for planers and command in the US/Coalition. \n\nArgument about human loses - well, all the US/Coalition soldiers are evacuated in time.""&gt; will the US allow the SDF to make peace with the regime? Will they ever pack up their bases and leave?\n\nThe first question is&gt; Why are they (US and Coalition) there in the first place? Because fighting the ISIL or something else? \n\n- preventing SAA, thus Syria, to recapture oil fields (suited for country's rebuilding),\n\n- preventing Iran (IRGC/Hezbollah/PMU...) presence and influence,\n\n- and maybe most important - creating havoc and trouble to hostile government, which happen to be allayed to the Russia...\n\nI believe that the answer is then obvious. Nope.""&gt; Has the US bombed the PMUs before for entering Syrian soil after ISIS?\n\nYup, and as matter of fact - and on the Iraqi soil to. Please, Google! It or search 'reddit' - this happened more than once. \n\nThe most famous case was the one of latest (some calls it ambush) with the Russian mercenaries among the ranks...""&gt; those there Syrian Government Militias that the US bombed with the Russia Mercs\n\nThey were Shia militia and mainly Iraqi and Lebanon citizen, to be honest. The US identifies them as 'IRGC affiliated'.\n\nAnyway, why this was supposedly an ambush? Scenario goes like this&gt;     \n\nSupposedly ISIL recapture few settlements between the SAA and SDF, held before by SDF or to be precise, by MC of Deir Ez-Zor. So, this militia saw the opportunity. When they were near the 'line' they did send reconnaissance group with few vehicles, when suddenly fighters in those settlements, rise SDF/FSA flag!       \nAnd before they managed to retreat, all hell broke loose, including, even and B-52s, Apache, HIMARS... etc. So, they learned their lesson hard way - and if the any SDF units now even officially calls for 'support' or 'help', no one will believe them.\n""Some those DMC, didnt even have their weapons on them. \n\n""I can't lol hard enough at this. \n\nU.S. special forces wouldn't be captured under any circumstances. ""Some elements of SDF are incredibly weak.  I'd take YPG over TFSA in a fight if air support was even/non-existent.\n\nThese guys were basically SDF's version of NDF.  ISIS took full advantage of that, combined with their classic sandstorm tactics.""YPG proved themselves on the Sajur River when TAF/TFSA tried to attack Manbij from the north.  Yes, YPG would have been overrun had the Americans not stepped in.  However, YPG was able to destroy several TAF tanks and stand their ground in the absence of American air support.""What became TFSA would have been overrun by ISIS in Mare and Azaz had Turkey not stepped in.  Ironically, Afrin YPG also played a significant role in aiding what became TFSA in that attack.""Being \"practically the only ones in the ME\" makes it perfectly reasonable for a sane person to want the status quo.  Most people want safety and security, even if that means living in an autocracy.""Iraq would be pressured into giving that territory to SAA rather than what Damascus considers to be a rebel group.  I'm not sure the U.S. wants that.""Those guys would call an airstrike on themselves before they get captured.  Even if they did somehow get captured, the U.S. wouldn't negotiate with ISIS.\n\nedit:  Oh it's ArabMorrocan... now this makes sense.""The U.S. prefers a weaker Assad position because it also weakens the position of Iran and Russia.""&gt;I always rely on others since I\u2019m not risking getting the NSA on me if I\u2019m not already.\n\nYou're already flagged just by being here.  It doesn't become a problem for you unless you start posting stuff showing support for jihadists.  Searching for educational purposes is fine.  I actually sourced jihadology for a paper I did for a political science class.""There is a pronounced difference between 3 US grunts getting ambushed guarding an isolated CP and managing to capture a Spec Ops team in the middle of open desert. \n\n""Wow he put some effort into this one. ""How many have been captured? No one is invincible, they of course can be killed, but the idea that a full team was captured with only Nidal and ArabMorrocan reporting it, of course it isn't true. \n\nIf it was true, they'd damn well have shared photos. They'd be shouting it from the roof tops. \n\nYou seem to think I am saying \"America Stronk never lose\". I'm saying that the claim that five were CAPTURED, is implausible. I'd buy them possibly being killed, but captured? I doubt it. ""Oh that's precious. \n\n""ISIS destroyed one, the Azaz FSA (before OB) destroyed another, and I'm not sure about the third.

""It's really not about that's it's about diluting US control and influence south of their border. The YPG are a perfect excuse. ""Additionally, US budget deficit has doubled since last year. There is no way they can afford to escalate. \n\nHowever, I have no idea how Turkey manages to operate on the field when the lira is so weak and they purchase fuel in EUROs/Dollars. ""Iraq was supposed to be a few billion dollars. Real cost close to 1.4TN.\nYou live in some fantasy land if you expect citizens in Turkey to support US occupation. \n\nTrump is stupid, but he's not that financially stupid. He's got a lot of domestic problems coming his way that he needs money for. Market has been down all of October as well. \n\nMy point is, Turkey can make an ugly dent in US plans, but I wonder what will be traded to prevent that from happening. \n\nI still don't understand how Turkey manages to operate it's military with the currency variances. Gas in Turkey is a big expense. ""Its been so long since I've seen WOA. \n\nI thought he had finally been eradicated from the sub. \n\nUnrelated note, I love the username OP"
