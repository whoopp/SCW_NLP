For the SDF to accept, they'd have to get a better deal from Bashar \"I'm going to take back every inch of Syria by force\" Assad than their current semi-autonomy under US protection. Somehow I don't think that's going to happen.\n\nAnd if your argument is \"They'll reconcile after the USA leaves\", that's a scenario where the USA willingly gives up influence (as opposed to having zero influence to begin with). It's also not a likely scenario, given the precedent for how long US troops have been in Iraqi Kurdistan. As long as the deployment is low casualty and relatively low cost, they're not going anywhere.""&gt; The SDF will reintegrate into the government.\n\nThe government would have to give them a better deal than semi-autonomy/virtual independence under US protection. It's not happening.""&gt; Government has an oil in deal with them\n\nThe government had an oil deal with ISIS too. They also had a similar agreement to pay civil servants working under ISIS, just as with the SDF. ""&gt; It's not a strategic area. \n\nIt actually is. Northeast Syria was traditionally the bread basket for Syria, and also holds all the oil. Between that and al-Tanf, it also gives some ability to complicate Iran's access to the Mediterranean and Lebanon, which is a big deal for US strategic partner Israel. Not as much as if they also control Al Bukamal, but if the Russians ever leave that might be in the cards at some point in the future.\n\nPropping up the SDF actually gives the USA huge leverage in the greater Levant region as a result.""That's their plan actually. Helping them return by enabling them to have a life in Syria.""&gt; Apart from the fact they don't give a shit about refugees?\n\nNot giving a shit is  traveling to the country to help them get their lives back?\n\n\nLet me guess: giving a shit about refugees manifests in calling for sanctions on Millions of Syrians to maybe inconvenience Assad a little bit.""And why wouldnt it be safe to return to most of Syria outside Idlib?""Most refugees arent dissidents.""Half of all refugees live in Syria, most with Assad. If he wanted to kill refugees, there'd be plenty in his Hands as is. No reason for those outside not to return, if possible.""It's not some, but millions, and if it's safe enough for them, then it's safe enough for many outside, yes. \"Safe\" doesnt mean \"perfect conditions\".""&gt; Theyll dump the SDF when they dont benefit them any more and the SDF knows this. They are landlocked by countries that dont like them much or the US.\n\nSo maintaining a presence in \"Rojava\" indefinitely benefits the USA, because it thwarts the territorial ambitions of anti-American countries. You just made an argument for an indefinite American deployment, whether you realize it or not.\n\n""So Russia will continue to [show footage from movie dramatizations](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2018/4/17/proof-of-staged-syria-chemical-attack-is-from-film) like *Revolution Man* while passing it off as real footage of \"rebel false flags\"?""&gt; But safe for one doesn't mean safe for all, most displaced within the country live in refugee camps, that's not considered 'safe' for returning refugees.\n\nWhy not?

They weren't even primarily concerned with bioweapons, at least not in the Caucuses, but were working in making sure that pandemic flu didn't cross over from Asia into Europe. That's what most of the DTRA labs are doing these days anyways, setting up local labs to prepare for pandemic diseases, since most of the countries they're working in haven't invested in threat reduction since the Soviet Union collapsed and have horrendously bad public health sectors.\n\nIf they've been looking into anthrax, hoof and mouth disease, and Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever, it's because all of those things are **endemic to the Caucasus, particularly the local sheep, goat, hedgehog, and rabbit population**, not because the evil Americans introduced the diseases.

Here's an important update on the Syria Month-by-Month series: We have the entire script of every Prelude to War episode written and the first episode is already recorded, but he have an issue. Our main video editor is not able to devote as much time as he would like due to real life circumstances. So, I am again appealing to you guys for help. We can release the first episode soon if someone with video editing expertise helps us out. I'm not going to lie, these first few episodes are going to be pretty low-tech, but it's what we can manage with zero budget. After all of these prelude episodes are released, we'll begin producing the regular episode on each month of the war.""Is this again   the \"second line of defense\"? All of 'em arab-leading commanders only?\n\n\nI am the last one who complains about anyone fighting ISIS anywhere. But we should be honest about the details. That is vital for post-war settlements and preventing another isis-surge.""I was able to contact local sources who confirmed the siege of Mashada was never reinstated since it was first broken.""I very much doubt it""There is no siege of Mashada.""if jolani doest think of something smart quick there wont be any HTS commanders left soonn.""If they have so many men, why do we keep seing YPG on \"second lines of defense\", teens at the front and little gains?\n\n\nI rather think it's safe to say the SDF was unable to truly rally one of the more important tribes to their cause.""Feels like someone at twitter HQ has a personal vendetta agains this guy. Even regular ISIS accounts regularly outlive him.""Please. Now, two hours later, it turns out that SDF was indeed kicked out of Susah entirely. Your sources were just wrong / not up to date.""They are suspended because of the sandstorm.""American commanders are surprised that ISIS counterattacks in a sandstorm. No surprise they cant captured a bunch of villages there.""In which of the x tiny villages they still have were they hiding that \"massive attacking force\"?""I mean he literally says it was surprising to him, so there is that.""So he is trying to make himself look more stupid than he actually is? Why?""by claiming they were surprised ISIS attacks during sandstorms?""Come on man, you only see what you want to see.\n\nThis is like someone stupidly shoots themselves in the foot and their friend goes \"ohhh he actually isnt stupid, he was just really surprised a bullet comes out of a gun if you squeeze the trigger\".\n\n\nIf he wanted to downplay the situation he should have said that they basically knew there were gonna be setbacks, planes cant fly with sandstorms, ISIS has always gained ground in sandstorms, \"strategic withdrawal\", etc.""not current sandstorm though.""YPG has largely relied on USAF flattening territory, then they moved in and ISIS moved back a bit. Rinse and repeat. They only suffered &lt;300 killed in the entire offensive up to Raqa. And most of that was probably to IEDS and mines.\n\n\nNow ISIS has nowhere left to run.""if true ISIS will likely ask for a stop of air strikes during negotiations. So we should watch for a silence of airstrikes after the storm settles.""shhhhh i am growing tired of him getting banned. he even retweeted the US army to look more legit ffs.""or maybe they just arent that major""call yourself friend of syria, then demand syrians be terrorized economically because it might bother Assad a bit. classy.""Why should Israel take in people that want to destroy their country? ""Would it help if they made a big fuzz?""I know.""This is the same dual American-Saudi national who has been held since September 2017 when he was captured by the SDF under unclear circumstances. There wasn't enough evidence to charge him, and the military technically didn't have authority to hold him without a trial, so he entered some kind of legal limbo for months.\n\nOriginally they were going to dump him in the Syrian desert with a cell phone and $4,000 in cash, but his lawyers (I think pro-bono from the ACLU) argued that it would be safer to release him in a third country willing to take him instead. Saudi Arabia wasn't considered an option due to the possibility of torture, but I'm not entirely certain how Bahrain would be much better.""If he acquired his citizenship through birth, there is no constitutional method for it to be involuntarily revoked. Only naturalized citizens can have their citizenship revoked, and even then there's a ton of obstacles. \n\nFor example, membership in a group like ISIS is grounds to have naturalized citizenship revoked, but only if he joined ISIS within 5 years of acquiring citizenship- and that membership would have to be *proven*, which seems to be an issue with this guy.""There's a lot of videos like this circulating among soldiers and militiamen in Syria- such violent men aren't the norm, but there's definitely enough of them to be a problem, especially in the less disciplined armed formations which practically encourage looting, rape, and random violence. These videos get traded between the fighters who are into this kind of violence, and sometimes they get posted into closed social media groups supporting a particular unit or faction- and from there out onto the general internet. It's something meant to be distributed, but only to a select group of violent people who like to see the side they support committing violent acts. Basically like ISIS propaganda, but for a much smaller intended audience. \n\nAnd for a long time, it was common for summary field executions to be justified as \"We found videos of people being tortured/raped/executed on his phone\", that's how well-known this issue is.\n\nIf you do a search of the /r/SyrianCivilWar archive, you'll see plenty of examples of essentially every faction beheading people, running them over with tanks, or other such atrocities. All filmed on camera phones and sent to friends. One of the worst was the Iraqi unit which apparently skinned a man alive and tied his corpse to their HMMWV. I wouldn't recommend watching any of these videos, but they're there. \n""They do have a similar unclean status (though they've long been kept as pets or guard animals by some people), plus stray dogs are viewed as vermin or a nuisance in most countries anyways. Doesn't excuse the act obviously.""Cats are well-thought of in Islam though, so I'm not sure if that's representative of the general Syrian view towards unclean animals like street dogs.""Oh for fucks sake. This is a huge blow, if true.\n\nAny secondary confirmations?\n\n\nedit. nothing from hts fanboys or official sources. though they do claim clashes with zinki near aleppo ... seems we are ready for another round ...""lol how is HTS even close to these villages? they are supposed to be deep inside NLF territory.""literally any map. The nearest HTS positions should be in Khan al Assal.""Which group?""What else impressive is there they could possibly have?""Here we go again ... they need to stop announcing shit and start getting it done.""Seems Iraqi faith in US/SDF is limited.""ISIS are incredibly determined. Let us remind ourselves the Syrian Army can't take the Al-Safa pocket. The Turkish threat is a legitimate reason to pause the offensive.""Thanks for pointing that out."
