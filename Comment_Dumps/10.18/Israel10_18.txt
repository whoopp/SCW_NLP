Although I suppose it is largely one of appeasing the Trump admin, as opposed to literal intentions, as it is quite clear how Trump reacts to anything negative to his admin. \n\n\nEspecially with the rumours of Haley looking to do a Clinton style presidential run. ""I'd argue, the issue is that bellingcat has very much started to align itself with more and more groups of very partisan (in geopolitical terms) motivations, such as the atlantic council, which was originally denied by higgins until they admitted it later on. \n\nthe most questionable funding for Bellingcat being that from NED or the \"National Endowment for Democracy\".\n\n\nI discussed it to further length here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8m0llu/bellingcat_russian_highranking_military_officer/dzkgk7d/\n\n\na specific quote of Ron Paul about NED being: \n\n&gt;\"very little to do with democracy. It is an organization that uses US tax money to actually subvert democracy, by showering funding on favored political parties or movements overseas. It underwrites color-coded \u2018people\u2019s revolutions\u2019 overseas that look more like pages out of Lenin\u2019s writings on stealing power than genuine indigenous democratic movements.\"\n\n\n\nNow, we can jump to whataboutism with regards to Russia, but it is clear that Higgins has exploited his position much more than Osama Suleiman (of SYrian Observatory for Human Rights) and has increasingly taken a position that for all intents and purposes I will liken to Assange: \n\n\nHe has good relations with governments that are positive to the news he is putting out (or bad relations at least with the contrary country), and will push whatever they have towards the ideals of that government. \n\n\nAlthough with Assange it is far easier to verify proper publications, whilst Higgins is largely about as viable as most people from the sub if they got paid to spend hours looking things up. Not to say he's wrong, but that's largely it with his open source approach, unless there is a closed source approach he utilizes, yet that would undermine the nature of bellingcat. ""It is to be noted: \n\nCapture of chlorine containers, especially when attacking civilian infrastructure is expected of a described \"terror group\" but the presence of such containers in civilian environments is largely to be expected. \n\n\n\nSo it is quite likely that ISIS did capture chlorine containers, yet their use could have been for civil purposes. \n\n\nIt's also possible that the original intention for these containers could be military or false flag related. \n\n\nIt's nothing new for ISIS to use chemical weapons, as has been alleged elsewhere. \n\n\nWe also note that TFSA groups had been accused by the SDF and allegedly confirmed by the SOHR to have used gas in afrin. \n\n\n\nSo ownership of Chlorine canisters is to be expected, although motivations are harder to infer. ""There has been a degree of protests across Rojava and captured areas. \n\nHere is a comment i left a while back that describes it further:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/994x4t/i_am_vice_correspondent_isobel_yeung_i_reported/e4mnj0s/\n\n\n a bit more has happened since, but it does suggest that tensions are climbing with regards to the SDF. \n\n\nOne major factor few have considered: \n\nthe majority of infighting in the green rebels occurred when the syrian gov and rebels had the least direct conflict. \n\n\nOnce Hajin is gone then what? \n\nAs the SDf have built a military structure akin to Hitlers Germany in the 30's, where the military was too large to be sustainable and needed conflict. The arabs will likely get dropped first, and US funding only goes so far, without stability outside of their military doctrine then the SDF may be in for a bad way during the next year, as eyes will look at areas currently ignored due to the threat of ISIS. ""The issue being one of lack of certainty as to his source of funding as there was less than 12 months between them being listed and not listed with an uncertain degree of time since said deal started. \n\nNow generally these deals would take at least a few months to sort out, especially for somebody like higgins, who would want to vet for bias and remove any potential for contaminating sources. He woudn't jump on funding willy nilly. \n\n\n\nFurther to that, there is no confirmation as to when funding was first supplied,  now further to that, research bids or funding bids generally take some time, outside of exceptional circumstances would you get them in a month. \n\nSo it is quite unlikely that Higgins was not positioning himself (for a long time to be fair) for funding from certain sources under he bellingcat logo. \n\nNow with open source, it can be valid, but only based on what they view and how they perceive it. I could do an \"open source\" perspective or Arch linux and deem it less secure or more likely to give your viruses than mac or windows. \n\n\nThe issue with his credibility is instantly placed upon being backed \nby groups that are deemed to be the political version of a russian troll farm.

What instead happened, at least looking back, would indicate that the radicals were the ones making the change while more camera friendly groups did all the talking / media ops. A highly effective model and one that was very much inline with Bin Ladens intention of re-branding al queda prior to his death. \n\n\nWar on the rocks had a very well written and sourced piece on the al queda re-branding, which in context of groups like ISIS and Nusra, alongside other al queda inspired groups, gives quite a reasonable deal of insight into how exactly they penetrated the revolution early on and made sure to exploit the media friendly nature of the weak local groups\n\nhttps://warontherocks.com/2015/09/extreme-makeover-jihadist-edition-al-qaedas-rebranding-campaign/""Are we seeing pro rebel tweeps starting to turn on Alloush? \n\n\nLet's not mince words here, Alloush was and always had been the strongest figure in any non radical rebel group. If there was ever a single figure that could unify the opposition then it would be Alloush. \n\n\nThis is some intense re-writing of history, nearly on par with the \"Assad released islamists to undermine the revolution\" or \"Suheil al Hassan died in Idllib and was replaced by a homosexual man who underwent lots of plastic surgery, yet is somehow a better leader even though Allah shouldn't allow it\", or the famous nusra explanation for aleppo being that the fighters \"used bad language\" too much, nonsense. \n\n\n\nThe viewpoint here would appear to me as more finger pointing for why the revolution failed, effectively blaming others and infighting, which in a sense is slightly ironic for rebel supporters to turn to infighting against other rebel groups when trying to work out why the revolution failed. ""Bloody hell, the bloke walking round the back likely took a massive amount of shrapnel from that one.
