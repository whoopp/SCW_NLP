"Why would you compare it to the 15-year long war in Iraq or the Soviet-Afghan War? The USA's own intervention in Syria seems like a much better comparison, being of overall of similar size and methods. It's also pretty questionable to not count the 89 soldiers who died in that TU-154 crash or the hundreds of Wagner paramilitary deaths. Presumably it's because losing 16 aircraft and 200 men (exclusive of contractors) on an operation this size is pretty poor compared to the Coalition losing 2 planes and 6 men. ""[Just one.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aviation_shootdowns_and_accidents_during_the_Syrian_Civil_War) An F-16 crashed.""I love it when this sub selectively chooses to believe or not believe SOHR statistics.""Well you can rest assured it won't be a gift basket. SRBMs aren't exactly pinpoint accurate.""He's just baiting you with a vague one liner that barely relates to your comment. He does it pretty regularly but mods tend to let his comments slide all the time despite them being \"low effort(r9) and baiting (r4)\". You clearly never called SDF a magic organization, if anything you called them inevitably corrupt.\n\nEdit: and then gaslights by shadow editing his comments.""65 sounds unbelievable... the AK variants I saw being sold on the telegram markets were several hundred dollars ""Barring acts of God or any unforeseen developments, which could still very well happen, the war won't see the light of 2020, in my hopeful opinion. Will it finish before 2019? I highly doubt it. Something tells me that Assad and Putin wanted to see it closed before then but between the US, the UN, and Turkey all trying to prevent what they see as \"the Idlib crisis\" the offensive seems to have been delayed or at least progressing much slower than Daraa for example.\n\nThat being said Idlib has been seen as one of the last major obstacles to a negotiation that could lead to a declaration that the civil war is over. I think it goes without saying though that Syria will feel the effects of this war for the coming decades.\n\nEdit: words""Would be interesting to see if this ends up being a first deployment for 2nd or 3rd SFAB, considering 1st SFAB is already in Afghanistan.""Iraq declared victory against ISIS (because ISIS held no territory Iraq by December 2017, after the U.S. pretty much flattened their entire organization with bombs). The USA hasn't and maintains they're a threat in Syria. Though they might declare victory by the time Operation Roundup is finished capturing ISIS's last pocket.""Death penalty for ISIS fighters is fair. Not sure why we'd continue to spend resources to keep them alive in a jail. ""The US and its allies are about 60-70% of global GDP (bare minimum you have USA: 24%, EU: 21%, Japan: 6%, Norway + Canada + Australia + New Zealand: 4%,  GCC + Turkey: 3%,  South Korea: 2%, Taiwan + Israel: 1%).""&gt;And what % of the world population would that be?\n\nWho gives a shit?""&gt;The actual international community.\n\nIndia and China don't care, not even a little bit. Neither does most of Africa. And of course the aforementioned US bloc with their 60-70% global GDP don't care.\n\n&gt;(that is the result of many of these wars to begin with).\n\nNope. Wars truthfully have little impact on this compared to smart policy. Utterly war-ravaged countries with little in the way of natural resources have quickly ascended to first world status with intelligent leadership, such as South Korea, Israel, and Taiwan. Meanwhile, countries with long periods of peace (bar their own foreign adventures) and plentiful natural resources can stagnate or decline and become relatively even weaker than they were already were. Like pre-war Syria or Venezuela.""Except for the part where the YPG clashed with the Assad government  in the north, killing nearly 400 and capturing nearly 800 government troops in [in 2013 alone.](https://anfenglish.com/news/ypg-release-balance-sheet-of-war-for-2013-9037) [Counting all the clashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFNS%E2%80%93Syria_relations) of the last few years (including the ones where the YPG/SDF were backed up by the Americans) these events add up to easily several thousand NDF/SAA casualties""What is the catch? China always wants something further down the road.""What they are signaling geopolitically is their willingness to work with Syria and its regime, but only if they follow the US's interests. It's a meaningless gesture *right now*, since their interests are not aligned, but oh well.""Housing is a verb in this context. And yes, they we're discussing if effort and money should be spent to \"house\" these women in a Canadian jail, which is gonna cost a ton of taxpayer money over the years. \n\nI think some people are just hoping the SDF would follow Bahgdad's example and sentence international ISIS members fast death sentences""Might be for either internal security or for EOD, both of which fit into the Bearcat's mission set.""I know back in the Islamic State's prime they would have made a show of executing these guys. I have heard a lot of stories of them taking hostages to trade for men or safe passage though. Anyone want to guess what will happen to these guys? Whatever it is will be an awful experience either way.""Syria against U.S. Army I believe thats not so smart.""A good comparison would have involved losing New Orleans to gangs or some armed group and not to a natural disaster. \n\nThe US didn't set up in NE Syria after a natural disaster but after a brutal jihadist organization took control for months and years with the government not taking it back and leaving the people to be brutalized by ISIS.\n\n*a few words for clarity \n""I think a lot of people are forgetting that reports are suggesting that Hajin pocket is nothing but foreign fighters. It doesnt surprise me it's taking this long. ""Isnt Crimea not doing too well economically right now? I dont understand how they'd be able to afford money on another country.""Conventionally, sure. But if Iran turns into an insurgency like Iraq, then it would be 10x worse than Iraq was in 2007.""Not from India. Most Indians are pretty pro US. I was born in Western India.""RT. Can't live with it, can't live without it.""Who is saying that every single building in Raqqa is rebuilt and all of the schools are up and running? Because the Coalition sure isnt.

""Why would someone want to use this in combat??""What are you talking about? Regarding first world militaries, the US takes the most pre cautions to avoid civilian casualties. During the Obama administration, US Fighter Jets who were en route to carry out strikes were told to turn around and go back to base because civilians walked into the bombing zone last minute. ""I remeber seeing this then. The possibility of them encountering the SAA while training with the paintball guns was brought up haha""You seem to lack a sense of scale here, because the Russian number is obviously completely impossible. [The Americans launched 170,000 sorties](https://dod.defense.gov/OIR/) between Iraq and Syria and they claim to have killed [fewer enemy combatants than the Russians have](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/once-promised-paradise-isis-fighters-end-up-in-mass-graves). Even though the Russians have less than 1/4 of the sorties (the article claims 39,000 for the Russians) and generally inferior weapons and pilots.\n\nEvery military miscalculates or overstates their enemy's casualties during wartime, but the Russian military seems to be unique in just how little they care about making their statements seem even the least bit believable.  See also: trying to back military claims with video game footage. The amount of fighters they claimed to have killed roughly matches estimates for ALL rebel and ISIS deaths in the entire war.""In my university class about modern France, I learned about what the French did to their women who got friendly with the Germans after the Nazis got kicked out. [It wasn't pretty](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/05/women-victims-d-day-landings-second-world-war)\n\n\n\n\n\nI have heard stories of U.S. troops who married and took home the Vietnamese bar girls they met. Some of these marriages worked out just fine too so I guess I am in no position to judge. The wars in the middle east are so radically different than the Vietnemase and WW2 though that relationships between western soldiers and middle eastern women were rare. The U.S. and locals in the ME did so much to separate their women from western troops that even rapes are very rare. And that isn't due to lack of male desire for sex either. \n\n\n\nIn any case, if it is all consensual and the girl gets a better life outside in a western country or even Turkey, it is all good in my book. One more soul out of a war zone is very good in fact. ""There were skirmishes in that pocket before that the SDF won. In the city of Hasakah itself the NDF is only allowed a police force without heavy weapons in a small part of the city. In total they are a minimal threat to the SDF but are useful negotiating tools. The small enclaves allow the SAA/Iran/RU to spectate the U.S. and give the government still somewhat of a claim over the eastern part of the country.  ""Russia and Turkey worked out a deal to prevent an Idlib offensive. Who knows how long it will last. Turkey is not giving up Afrin or the rest of the TFSA areas they captured from the SDF and ISIS. They invested too much blood, money, and time to just hand it over to anyone else. Besides they have the western world's diplomatic support for their buffer zone / refugee settlement.""With a username like that I'm sure it's a throwaway account and he probably doesn't care. ""Nope. Russia has been doing it to the US since 2015 in Syria. The US asked Russia to stop and Russia didnt respond. So now the US is doing it back.""Yeah, I commented before I read the article itself. What a clickbait title. "".@CENTCOM confirms visit: \"Gen. Votel thinks Al Tanf is an important base to help prevent a resurgence of ISIS. He also acknowledges that the location of the base &amp; our work w/ partners in Syria has an indirect impact in making Iranian malign activities in Syria more difficult\" ""To be fair there are still occasional reports of ISIS attacks in that region.""Russia wont risk confrontation with the US over Iran. Syria? Maybe, as that sends a political/assurance message to the world on behalf of Russia. But not Iran.""Pretty sure all they have is HIMARS, Howitzers, Mortars, and constant 24/7 air cover.""What do you think the SAA is doing?\n\nAnyways this is more of a military organizational problem for the SDF than a morale one. Having a bunch garrisoned in bases and cities, and keep a good chunk in the reserves, and they'll be good to go.""Sure America failed at toppling Assad. But we did manage to create an ethnic enclave in one third of the country that wants us to never leave. We built a second quicker land corridor through Turkey, and Syria into Kurdish Iraq that bypasses the unreliable Arab states. And it didn't cost us many American lives.\n\nFuck, this kinda worked out well if you think about it.""The Syrian government encouraged and allowed AQI to operate in eastern Syria. Let's not act like we ruined a great relationship anyway. Besides Syria and Iran were close in the first place. ""This isn't a football game. There is no losing or winning. There is just outcomes. The outcome in Syria is not the worst in the world for America. Iran now has more liabilities across the middle East and antagonized the Sunni Arabs, Turks, and Israeli. They are on borrowed time. We just have to be patient. ""Last time pro SAA militias tried entering the 55km buffer zone around that base they were bombed instantly.""No. There's been occasions where the SDF has fought pro SAA forces in Quamishlo and Hasakah. That doesnt mean that the Kurds are officially at war with the Syrian Army.""Unless this particular group of SOF had priority of fires and Erdogan went on an even more slobberingly vitriolic tirade, I doubt it.""&gt; I wouldn't be surprised if during these joint patrols inside Manbij might lead to some light clashes between Turkish-US forces\n\nDirect clashes between Turkey and the US? If I understood that right, No. The US and Turkey train together abroad all the time.""All good no worries ""I went ahead and added some detail, cheers ""Its been known that ISIS has launched sniper positions from Mosques before. It shouldnt be surprising. ""Its been known that ISIS has launched sniper positions from Mosques before. It shouldnt be surprising. ""Ah, my bad""All I know is that it's surplus Navy digital camo. Completely useless, but it looks cool.""The US doesnt sell it as \"Invisible\". The US officially calls it \"Low Observable\" - meaning it is difficult to gather enough information about the aircraft to determine any details needed for a SAM at farther ranges. It is harder to shoot down than the listed aircraft on the right conditions, but as you mentioned, not impossible.""Because that pocket is nothing but foreign fighters according to the guys on the ground.""I don't think he was saying Turkey=ISIS only that Turkey is smart enough to use the situation to their advantage. \n\nThey have the intelligence and it would work to their advantage to hit the SDF, as they have often stated is their enemies, when they shift forces to deal with ISIS. \n\nBut ultimately I think you're right and this is just the same kind of shelling the SDF has caught for a while now. ""As taught as early as Sun Tzu when he said always to leave a small opening to allow for them to retreat. If completely cornered, they will fight to the last man, as they have no other option. \n\n\"Therefore, the art of war lies in: never face a high mountain, never retreat from a down hill, never follow an enemy army faking defeat, never attack an elite enemy army, never bite a shark-bait, never chase after a retreating enemy army, leave opening for a surrounded enemy army, never pressure a desperate enemy army. This is the art of war.\"""Sorry about that, apparently he replied between me opening the page and replying. ""The C-17 can carry 1 Abrams or 3 Strykers.""It wouldn't surprise me if we buy a few T-55s or T-72s from a neutral country and then donate them as foreign aid in order to keep the SDF's logistical pipeline simplified.""&gt;I hope that once this war quiets down enough, Assad fixes his prison system and ends this injustice\n\nYou're out of your mind if you think this isn't entirely by design, along with the tens of thousands of people being murdered therein. ""Anything's possible. Unlikely, granted, but possible.""Aircrsft and cargo boats""This is very disturbing. Sick bastards.
