But still Assad had the support of like almost half of the pre war Syrian population and now(due to Sunni heavy migration) is probably half or a little bit more. Nobody (included Assad himself) believes Syria is a democratic country so why to use the word \"democratic\"? \n\nPlus we talking about support, not elections. Question is why the dictator Assad has such support, where in general dictators (like Ceausescu) have/had almost none? Why?""Ceausescu had no support to remain in power. The security apparatus seeing what's going on around have organized to overthrow him. Ceausescu had no support from the army or from the people. Later on, in the transitional period some people especially in the older lower class of society came to regret him because of their failure to adapt to a new type of economic system. But in 89 he had no support.\n\nAssad's elections are not legit, but here we discuss about his support, which he has. And he has it because Assad's regime has an unique situation. It's support comes mainly from minorities which security is threaten if Sunnis come in power. And security is the most important thing for most human beings. Of course is not about being a good leader, it is because of him being  the lesser evil. \n\nBut isn't this the case with Europe, as well as with your country - Romania(where society usually vote against)? The majority of people in Europe as well as in your country vote for the lesser evil, for the other being less bad. So Assad's support in principle is no different, it is supported by people who think he's the lesser evil, the less bad choice.\n\nNow if I may why did you support the rebels? Your father I suppose is an educated man(as is the case with most of Romanians of Syrian origin), I guess he knows well that it was always between Assad and Islamists...

It doesn't make any sense that it would take the SDF 4 months to take Raqqa and over 10 months to take Hajin.  \n  \nBy the way, If the SDF wanted to minimize causalities they have failed at it. The SAA took advantage of the ISIL collapse in Syria, and took Mayadin with less than 40 killed. The SDF decided to procrastinate and has since taken hundreds of causalities in clashes around Hajin.""Read the rest of the comment.""Well, Your comment seemed to imply that i was against minimizing casualities, which i was not. The point of my comment was that what the SDF was currently doing did not minimize casualities. As [this wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_ez-Zor_campaign_(September_2017\u2013present\\)) shows, The SDF suffered 47 killed between January and March 2018, and 206 killed between 10 September and 16 October 2018, Meaning there were at least 247 SDF soldiers killed around Hajin in 2018. Comparing this with the [Mayadin offensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Mayadin_offensive), where the SAA suffered only 38 killed by taking it quickly, It seems to me that taking Hajin slowly is maximizing rather than minimizing casualities.""Acorrding  to the video most of them are gone now.
