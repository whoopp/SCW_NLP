I don\u2019t think the entire government would meet and come to that conclusion (using chemical weapons), but I\u2019m sure a lower level commander would, and it\u2019s not as though every single tactical and strategic decision has to go by Assad first. It seems like the regional officers/commanders have quite a bit of leeway.\n\n\nBesides, it\u2019s the scenario with the fewest leaps in logic. I can imagine someone thinking chemical weapons would be useful while just bombing rebel areas into submission. I have a bit more trouble thinking the rebels themselves managed to perfectly replicate multiple attacks that all point right at the SAA.

Rigging elections with fraud discourage potential opposition when the one doing the rigging has a preponderance of power - lack of independent judiciary/rule of law, partisan intelligence services, control of media.\n\nLike elections in Russia and China, it is a strategy taken with a longer term goal in mind.""Not joining any militant group at all isn't an option? I have a few friends/acquittances who participated in demonstrations in 2011, and none of them joined militias. When things turned violent, most of them fled the country entirely (which is why so many \"secular\" Syrian opposition figures are residing in Istanbul).

Also, who would even replace him?""What are Shagar and blood marriages?""Locating and killing Bin Laden and Stuxnet are some of the most recent and high profile examples. The Argo operation in Iran is another. Also defeating the Soviets by arming the mujahedeen in Afghanistan was a success with respect to winning the cold war. Obviously it blew up in their face after the USS Cole and 9/11, but it was considered a major success at the time.  The CIA by nature is not an organization that flaunts its sucesses, so the general public is mostly ignorant of any successful or unsucessful operations. ""Totally fair points and i agree with the long term counter productive argument. They solve one issue and create another. Nevertheless, the US Govt needs a robust espionage apparatus if it wants to maintain its global hegemony, so I dont forsee see any meaningful changes anytime soon. ""Tough shit. They made a choice. Now they have to live with it.""The media has long devolved to over-simplification of participating organizations/factions. \"Assad's forces\", \"Shia militias\", \"Rebel forces\", \"Sunni extremists\". They never actually tell you who the hell they're talking about. \n\nThere's differences between the SAA and NDF. Differences between Hezbollah and LAAG. Differences between the NFL and NFLS. Differences between HTS and ISIS. They might all broadly fit under a certain umbrella for those terms, but as long as they operate with relative independence and autonomy, they can't be shoved together into the same pot.\n\nThen people watching it start forming ideas based on the absurdly over-simplified descriptions. It doesn't matter who you hate or support, a little bit of intellectual honesty goes a long way. These days the media leaves more questions than it gives answers considering how dumbly they cover these topics without any concern for accuracy.""If you're going for business, have you thought of trying to find contacts in Syria from organizations focused on future reconstruction planning and such? It might be rather challenging considering the immediate focus on the fighting for the most part, but a local sponsor/contact might make things a bit easier than a cold visit.\n\nI believe there's a Syrian embassy in Moscow, could check in with them and see if they'd be able to give you contacts. I don't know how much of a priority it'd be for them, but worth a shot. It's also possible that with the conflict, the person who might've handled business communications is just sitting there dying from boredom and just waiting for your call to brighten his day.\n\nI wouldn't mind doing it myself too(I'm a business consultant myself) but the US isn't exactly on good terms with Syria and I myself am a Turk, so it's like a double-noper at the moment.\n""Yeah, the timing of the Pastor\u2019s release indicates that the Turkish government wants to escalate the issue with SA and want US backing.""Why would it be one or the other?

There really is no going back now, and all parties know it.\n\nThis is obviously incorrect, as it wrongly presupposes that the YPG came to be out of thin air. Turkey's been the nemesis of the YPG since the YPG founding in Syria by the PKK. After all, decades of PKK attacks against Turkey is what solidly establishes the YPG as an actor harmful to Turkish security.\n\n""&gt;Erdogan doesn't need any evidence to promote kurdophobia anyway.\n\nCome on now, Kurdophobia has nothing to do with this. The PKK's been attacking Turkey since 1980s, and quite a lot of Turkish military and the entire village guard establishment is made up of Kurds defending themselves against the PKK.""&gt; Only Turkey sees them as terrorists.\n\nI'm hundred percent sure that a whole lot of important international actors besides Turkey also rightly designates the PKK as a foreign terror organization.""&gt; Turkey overtly supporting al-Qaeda\n\nThat is a meme though, I'm pretty sure only the HTS is supposedly somewhat connected to al-Qaeda and they keep clashing with Turks regarding Idlib?""&gt; Yes it is hypocritical by USA to brand PKK as terrorist at the same time support YPG as freedom fighters, but this is how USA's geopolitical interests looks like. USA could secretly support PKK if Turkey does something that goes against USA's interest.\n\nIt isn't hypocritical at all, especially if you take a look at the terrible acts perpetuated by the PKK. The PKK absolutely deserves the current designation it is currently subjected to by the international community. I do not believe that listing an extremist, violent and authoritarian far-left group that has made suicide bombings and targeting civilians it's forte can ever be considered an act of hypocrisy. If anything, it's an act justified by universal morality.""The YCR appears to be yet another KCK front group, propped up by the same cadres who are now wearing the SDF patches and are now commanding the YPG in Syria.\n\nThe KCK establishes such franchises directly and has done so in Syria, Iraq and Turkey. It's absurd to think that people unrelated to the KCK suddenly would pick up portraits of Ocalan whose ideology lacks substance and is essentially wholesale plagiarized from the likes of Murray Bookchin. The only mass appeal Ocalan can have is towards irredentist Kurdish nationalist and a very small, very obvious far-left, anarchist minority who are outsiders to Syria and think Ocalan is reviled by the Kurds because of his ideas and not because of a sense of nationalism.""I will be acting as well""The reason the SDF hasn\u2019t defeated the pocket is because it doesn\u2019t care too much about it.

It's not like Syria would accept the aid with all the stipulations attached to it anyways. Unless the US threatens countries already involved in reconstruction, like Japan and China, then its meaningless threats.""International sanctions do. Unilateral sanctions do not. Unless they plan to sanction every nation working in Syria, regardless of their affiliation with any state. I do not see the US easily pushing sanctions through; Russia/China would veto anything in the SC and the US would have trouble leveraging support for it in the GA, and it'd inevitably come out watered down, meaningless, and unable to be enforced like all other GA stuff.""The article says nothing about banks or neutral businesses. It says Russian and Iranian companies. Both of which have been previously targeted and will be minimally impacted by additional sanctions. It makes no mention of Chinese, Japanese, or other government and private aid and investment.\n\nWhich makes me think this is just bluster leading up to the mid-term elections and nothing more.""That last point is fantastic. A fatigued population does not care what solution is arrived upon, only that there is one. When the CIA tried to support anti-Communist Chinese insurgencies in the 1950's, they failed consistently to find any support outside of the Chushi Gangdruk who themselves had not been involved in the 30 years of strife.\n\nNo option available to Syria at this point comes without a cost. They can use Turkey to counter Russian and American influence and undermine the PYD, but at the cost of increased Turkish presence. They need the Russians around to keep the US from freely striking them, but the Russians have their own needs. They need the Iranians - well - probably because Iranian support is clearly the reason Assad was able to turn the tide and win the war and losing their support (and their militias) even now could compromise his dominant position.""They'd be better off hiding rather than giving away their position by \"firing in some faint hope of taking one down.\"""Khashoggi was an investigative reporter who covered the mujahedeen in Afghanistan. Like most Western and Arab journalists, he sympathized with them. I'd imagine most people in the West and Arab worlds were very supportive of them at the time.\n\nHe did not support terrorism or Bin Laden's extremism, lamenting that Osama fought for a just cause against the USSR but was consumed by hatred that was counter to Islamic principles afterwards. In 2003 he was fired from an editor position for criticizing a prominent Islamic scholar for teachings that justified violence against non-Muslims.\n\nHe's more an \"Islamist\" in the mold of the Muslim Brotherhood, which he was briefly a member of when he was younger. Even then, he stopped attending meetings fairly early on so while a fan of political Islam according to his friends, he wasn't a puppet of the MB.""I wonder what the curriculum was like then""A couple of international outlets are reporting that Putin made the comments (Haaretz and Fox News so far) but I haven't seen any reporting about US citizens being kidnapped""It's interesting that Putin said it, reporters should definitely be checking in with the state department to see if his statement is true\n\nbut he claims ISIS has issued ultimatums regarding the hostages - where are these ultimatums? ISIS is usually very public with their ultimatums""\"Fighting ISIS\".\n\nMore like two war tourists that wanted to pose with guns for cool pictures. \n\nThese cringey communist hipsters are getting out of control.   ""Makes me think back to the Armenian gang bangers from LA who were fighting in Syria earlier in the conflict.. one of the most bizarre videos I've seen from this war.""I think one died and one went to Armenia""I wonder if Assad will say anything about this raid. Cooperation with Iraq will be important to Syrian recovery, but another state\u2019s special operators working on his turf hurts state sovereignty claims.""I think it only hurts his sovereignty claims if he has delusions about the actual state of power in Syria. Assad's strength is built off a very broad and complex group of power brokers in Syria, not only externally with Foreign agents but internally within the Syrian government as well. Right now with how unstable the region is, Assad's only hope of actually closing this war for good is cooperating with as much of the region as he can. Obviously certain nations are unlikely to cooperate with Syria, but that just gives them more reason to seek allies in this instability. Iraq is unique in that is has suffered very similarly to Syria very recently, it would be easy for the governments to become allies considering how badly they both need to project power right now.\n\nFrankly I'd argue its very likely we see increased cooperation between both governments in the next 5 years. Nobody expects this well armed varied band of rebels to disappear any time soon, in fact many already resist in cells within re-captured territory. The Syrian and Iraqi economies are in shambles, it will be incredibly costly and time consuming to fight this insurgency; the problems facing these governments are incredible. I'd argue any energy spent between Syria and Iraq fucking with each other is complete incompetence. They need to focus their complete effort and resources on repairing their countries, not just for their peoples sake but too maintain any semblance of long term political control. Their interests over lap too much, and it can literally only make their situation worse by having any kind of conflict with the other.\n\nIf I was Assad my only response to this raid would be billing Russia for the fruit basket I sent to the Iraqi government. ""Well, considering that several international volunteers, including communist ones have died over there, I think they did a bit more than \"pose with guns for cool pictures\"""The siege?

Did this sniper really think he would be rewarded for doing this?""I agree that the 2003 invasion of Iraq was profoundly stupid and helped set the stage for ISIL. Because of that, I think we had a moral obligation to help the Iraqi government and the Syrian Kurds fight against ISIL.\n\nAlso, if you want to sell weapons stomping out ISIL is a bad deal. A permanent ISIL administration in Mosul and Raqqa would have been a cash cow for arms dealers""The SDF was distracted by Turkey in Afrin and Manbij for a couple of months and the US wants to have a justification for sticking around, so it hasn't committed that many assets to the fight.""The SDF was worried that Turkey was going to move on Manbij after Afrin and wasn\u2019t willing to commit more resources to fight ISIS.""This is just another episode of anti American shitposting. The U.S. can send aircraft into Syria from literally every bordering country, yet I'm supposed to believe we're powerless? U.S. aligned factions control 1/3 of Syrian territory. Any agreement made between opposing factions will have little effect on U.S. actions. Russia+company might as well pass a law to tell the Sun to stop shining, it'll have about the same effect. The only lasting solution in Syria will be one the we agree to.""Setting up the conditions of victory as a box excluding all the U.S. endeavors seems awfully convenient.""Iran is used as a necessary public justification for our actions; our real reason be being there is to use the area as a geopolitical card. America managed to use the Isis problem to create a middle eastern ally that actually likes us, and wants us to stay indefinitely. Good friends are hard to come by these days.""Good point.

Institutional inertia is more important.""I am relieved.""If we are assuming that no other foreign powers interfered either, then its safe to assume the SAAA would still be dealing with pockets around the country. Russian airpower was a huge deal when it came to retaking Aleppo, so who knows how much longer that process would have taken. The Russian military police have also helped with security around the country, so that would mean less Syrian manpower to spare for offensives. I think we'd probably have seen more aggressive Israeli/Western actions against the government if Russia had never intervened but if that wasn't the case we'd probably be following the same sequence of events just delayed without the Russian help.""any guesses on how far Erdogan will push against KSA?""US-Russian coordination efforts like this dispel the Russian propaganda about the US conducting the drone attack on Russian forces in Syria.""I don\u2019t agree with Hobbes\u2019 rationalization of absolute rule but in the case of Syria, it is what it is. You cannot have such disparate groups of people within one state without a autocrat to keep a lid on inter-religious and inter-ethnic strife. I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s justified because it\u2019s not, it\u2019s just the reality of the situation.""Just my guess but if he can discredit KSA or MBS, he can try to gain favor toward Turkey and himself in the region. Don\u2019t work with them, they kill journalists, work with me, you\u2019ve never *seen* me kill journalists (yes, I know what is happening to journalists in Turkey now).\n\nAnother part thing that I haven\u2019t seen much about is what are the Turkish people\u2019s thoughts on the murder? A not-so-small portion of the population is very dissatisfied with the state of the media and journalism in Turkey. Could he be acting tough to try to win some support back? \n\nMaybe he wants someone else other than MBS to rule KSA? ""Compared to most modern Western militaries, yes. Compare them to other places in the Middle East...\n\nSaudi Arabia constantly loses billion dollar tanks to thousand dollar RPG rounds because they don't know how to use them correctly. They constantly pour their tanks into places open canyons when they can be sniped from afar.\n\nPlaces like Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia where power structure is based on clans and tribal leadership rather than merit leads to poor training and performance.\n\nEvery military that took on Israel in the 7 day war failed from a combination of inefficient tactics and poor morale/willpower.\n\nI think the morale point is the more important one he made. Israel won the 7 day war because every country involved had little loyalty or anyone willing to die for their country, so they just retreated and got mowed down. ISIS gained traction because SAA (or whichever group it was) abandoned their weapons and equipment and tried to get away by dressing in civilian clothes. ISIS has a strong motivation and think they'll get to heaven when they die. For soldiers in *countries*, they would rather save their own skin than die for their country.""Yeah, if the US was to fully withdraw as some axis of resistance folks would like I wonder how long it would take for a fully resurgent ISIS to emerge?""Having no real way of surrendering tends to make a person a hardcore fighter.""This is a couple days old.

And the way they just have chunks of their heads and faces missing...nightmarish stuff. I can't really elaborate too much on ISIS without breaking Rule 8, but I expect that SDF will get their vengeance at some point. At least, it would be logical if they did.""Every time any updates come out in the Hajin operation we see the exact same comment that the SDF are going slow on purpose.  Everyone saw you write that on the post yesterday and the one the day before that. I also see pictures of SDF soldiers getting captured all the time and have for a long time heard foreign fighters mention that their friends are dying in this area. People also complain that coalition bombing is too aggressive, which really suggests that they are trying but facing resistance. \n\nI am also doubtful that the US even needs this pocket as an excuse. After Hajin is cleared we will just argue that we are fighting guerrillas or building institutions, and it will make no difference. No one considers that maybe lots of stuff is happening that doesn\u2019t show up on little maps that only show who controls each town. Also, looking at land area as a measurement of military strength doesn\u2019t make sense, because ISIS obviously get all of their money and bullets and soldiers from outside of their territory. If they were so weak the regime would just cross the river themselves, like they did at DeZ.

Unclean means we shouldn't touch them before we pray and that we shouldn't eat them. [It doesn't mean we should kill and torture them.](http://seekershub.org/ans-blog/2018/08/06/killing-dogs-islamic-command/)\n\n&gt;I also think it is important to address the statement that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him and grant him peace) hated dogs. This is incorrect. As we shall see there are a number of narrations in which He mentioned that people who had shown kindness to dogs were forgiven and rewarded by Allah.\n\n&gt;In fact, whilst on a military expedition to Mecca, he passed by a bitch laying in their path with her pups suckling from her. To prevent her from being harmed he ordered Ju\u02bfayl b. Suraqa to guard her lest any of the oncoming army disturb or harm them (Imt\u0101\u02bf al-Asm\u0101\u02bf, al-Muqrizi). Is this the action of someone who hated dogs? What\u2019s more is that his grandson Hasan had a puppy, which he left under a bed in the house of the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him and grant him peace), which caused the angel Jibril to not enter (Abu Dawud).\n\nHope that helps!""Is this the kind of thing you think would actually be punished?""Here's hoping she can turn this mess around.""...why was this posted, exactly? \n\n\nI'm sure there are subs dedicated to people who want to watch animals die horribly, but /r/syriancivilwar never really struck me as one. This contributes nothing at all, it's just fucking disgusting. \n\n\nGrisly execution videos of humans generally get taken down pretty quickly IIRC, and I don't really see why it should be any different for a dog. ""Having a buddy recording it and sharing it makes me think the friends he's sharing it to will approve of it.""Imports from Jordan may provide many Syrians financial relief, but I reckon Syrian small business won't be able to compete.""But Jordanians will likely be able to source, produce, and sell goods for cheaper than Syrians.""Not you specifically haha.  Meant \"you\" rhetorically.  Was referring to the comment not the post.  ""All this because of a fucking sandstorm.""As a Turk, would you agree with the PKK ending it's armed struggle in SE Turkey in exchange for autonomy? And if a referendum showed that most Kurds there supported autonomy?""&gt; Those who want to restore the Arab role in Syria should not do so through the Assad regime\n\nShall we replace him with Assad #2 or Assad #3?""Maybe Erdogan thinks Trump will blink with the midterm elections about to happen? Although it's probably too late for that, since they're in less than a week\n\nAlternatively, there are rumors that Trump might fire his secretary of defense after the midterms. If that happens John Bolton would be Trump's senior war advisor. Bolton's an old Bush admin guy who hates leftists so I could def see him betraying the SDF""The same definitely can't be said about Olive Branch areas. Why do people keep saying this?\n\nAnd they did stop the Turks in the Euphrates Shield areas so I don't know what you mean there."
