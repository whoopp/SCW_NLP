People with jobs, in university who also have great command of the language. A lot of Syrian doctors, dentists, Engineers and well educated people fall into this category. \n\nThe second part is people with stable occupations but are not so well integrated into the society, be it language or social differences. \n\nThe third part is people without jobs, who are what people call \"parasites\". \n\nThe first part of the society must really like Europe, and will not want to leave it to be in Syria. But on the other hand, Europe is also happy to have them. They have great jobs, and good connections to the society. \n\nThe second part is the partially functional one, where they either work or still working on their future but are not well integrated.

Form small circles of relatively isolated societies. \n\n3. Stay and try to integrate in the future. \n\nHere Europe usually is indifferent to them, but likes them to stay because of the investment they did.  Some people did leave Germany lately to comeback and live in Syria, and this happens all the time, albeit at a small rate. \n\nThe third part is the problematic part. People without jobs or complete isolation from the society. This includes all people who are unable to actually learn language or skills and is just sitting there receiving money. I do not think it is easy on that individual to do that, because all people like to work, they are either old or have a psychological/mental problem. \n\nThose people are most likely to be returned. If they find a way to stay, then there way much more hope for their children to live a better life and contributed to the society in the future. \n\nOverall, I see it a great move by Europe and for Europe to have accepted those refugees.

Garbage produced by those lazy people is way much better handled in Europe than in Syria. The products they buy in Europe might be way more environment friendly than in Syria.

First off, they have to *differentiate* between friend a foe and not bomb areas held by friendly forces. Second, there's little/no evidence of them actually bombing an area containing *just* civilians, or them bombing an area without reason for doing so. That doesn't seem very indiscriminate, does it? \n\nI think it's a bit hyperbolic to make such a statement. The SyAF has no doubt bombed civilian areas during the war. So has the United States in Afghanistan, Iraq, etc.. and so has every country utilize aerial bombing in conflicts around the world. It's misleading to call it \"indiscriminate\" because it's not as precise due to lack of technology, especially when efforts are made to make the bombings meaningful by destroying military targets.

Those previous ones were a \"trial\" ... And don't deny the foreign interference, as soon as it picked up all the west made statements to support it...

When Syria welcomed Iraqi refugees it did not have issues like Turkey and Lebanon have now with Syrian refugees... see the difference??\n\n&gt;I get where you sentiment comes from, but do you know how many people were killed under ben ali in tunesia? How many never showed up again after their imprisonment?\nOr how many people died under mubarak in egypt - a brutal military dictatorship.

Russia and China are also looking for their interest and influence in the middle east - that isnt completely exclusive to the west.\nThere is a lot of scholarship writing on the Palestinian issue - e.g. http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198749028.001.0001/acprof-9780198749028-chapter-10\n\nTorture is everywhere, even in the so called democratic western countries, I mean do I have to remind you of Iraq prisons during the US invasion.... or about waterboarding... and much more...\nnow tell me did torture end in Egypt? is death over in Libya? now you have a chaotic Libya with slaves markets.. so much for democracy... \n\n&gt;This is a complete lie.

Not doing it would be hypocritical.\nTell that to the people of Bahrain... Yemen and others... \n\n&gt;Then what is a \"genuine\" revolution? Do you not understand why people resent Assad? He tortured and killed thousands of people even before 2011, no one is allowed to criticize his family gaining wealth through corruption. Do you really think everyone in syria is accepting this? Why do you think the mukhabarat is so feared in syria?\n\nA genuine revolution would be by the people themselves, not sponsored by foreigners, because foreigners don't care about Syria, they care about their interests, hence right now we have this mess in Syria, it is because of foreign interference... \n\n&gt;Why would Europe want a huge amount of refugees? they are nearly breaking up the union by refusing to let refugees in (see Hungary).\n\nEurope did not think Alasad will last this long, they made a mistake and did not plan for the alternatives... this is the cost of interfering.. \nyou don't want refugees, simple don't start wars... you want to fix it now... simple remove the sanctions...

Syria was not able to distinguish Russian and Israeli planes. \n\n2. After the missile is launched, it depends on its heat sensor to detect the target. \n\nTherefore, if the missile is following the F16 and then it hides behind the Il20, the missile has no way of telling which heat signature is whose. Therefore, it will continue to follow the bigger heat signature, which is the Il20 and not the F16 because it is further away.\n\nSo the idea is that the missiles Syria had did not have the ability to distinguish targets after it is launched and assumed its projectile path.

They did that with the aid of the west and to some extent the regime themselves.\n\nSDF areas are plagued with humanitarian problems, lack of needed necessities etc, partly because the Political wing of the SDF is focusing on consolidating power over the territories that they control, they need aid and money, which they are going to get at some point, if they haven't already. It makes sense.\n\nThe US remains in Syria to destabilise and dismantle the regime in Damascus, it's in their geopolitical interest to do so and THEY will use the SDF and Kurds to do that, sooner or later the SDF/YPG would come to understand that.

It is planned to withdraw the opposition\u2019s tanks, multiple missile launcher systems, artillery systems and mortars from this zone. Control in this zone will be exercised by mobile patrol groups of Turkish troops and unites of Russian military police.\n\n\n&gt; Idlib is the only large region in Syria that is still controlled by illegal armed groups.

The Israeli security establishment believes that, if necessary, Israel's air force could still manage to strike targets in Syria despite the new missile batteries.\n\n&gt;The process of training Syrian soldiers to operate the missile batteries is expected take some time and the batteries themselves are not yet fully operative.\n\n&gt;However, Russia's main move is on the public and diplomatic front: Moscow is signaling to Israel that it intends to limit Israel\u2019s freedom to maneuver in the Syrian skies.\n\n&gt;The presence of Russian troops with the missile batteries will also make it harder for Israel to strike those batteries if missiles are fired from them at its air force jets.\n\n&gt;Netanyahu said two weeks ago that he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and that they had agreed to meet soon. No date for such a meeting has been announced yet.\n\n&gt;In the contacts that occurred in the days following the incident, the Russians were not enthusiastic about holding a high-level meeting and felt that the visit to Moscow by an Israeli military delegation headed by Maj. Gen. Amikam Norkin, commander of the air force, was sufficient.\n\n&gt;Norkin shared with his Russian counterparts the detailed findings of the air force investigation of the incident, which placed full responsibility for the downing of the plane on the Syrian Army.\n\n&gt;But Russia rejected these findings and issued its own account that accused the Israel Air Force of dangerous conduct and relied upon a completely different timetable of the events. Israeli officials believed the Russians had falsified the radar images they published of the event in order to pin the blame on the Israeli air force jets.\n\n&gt;Russia's moves do not spell the end of Israeli airstrikes in Syria. But now, more than a month after the incident, it is clear that something has fundamentally changed and that Israel will have to take a new diplomatic and military approach in order to preserve at least some of its freedom of operation.\n\n&gt;Thus it is worth re-examining the policies of the last few years. The string of successes by the intelligence community and the air force led to a feeling in the government that Israel could do practically whatever it pleases in Syria.\n\n&gt;Perhaps before the downing of the Russian plane occurred, Israel did not fully grasp the attitude shift in Moscow and Damascus that came with the Assad regime\u2019s major gains in southern Syria.\n\n&gt;After the offensive in Latakia during which the Ilyushin plane was shot down, the IDF said that the target struck included machinery for manufacturing equipment that would improve the precision of Hezbollah rockets. According to Israel, Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah militants were about to smuggle this equipment from Syria to Lebanon.\n\n&gt;The question, in retrospect, is whether this was indeed a target that justified an Israeli strike in the heart of the Russian area of influence and interest, close to Hmeimim air base and the Tartus port, both held by Russia. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that an impressive show of Israel\u2019s tactical and intelligence capabilities causes an entanglement on the strategic level.\n\n&gt;Last week, Fox News reported, quoting Western intelligence sources that Iran has recently increased the frequency of its arms shipments to Hezbollah using civilian flights to Beirut.\n\n&gt;According to the report, components for installing GPS navigation systems on Hezbollah\u2019s rockets to turn them into precision-guided weapons were transferred on Boeing 747s, some of which made stopovers at the Damascus airport.\n\n&gt;Hezbollah apparently still lacks the full technological capability needed to quickly and effectively install these components on its rockets in Lebanon in a way that would rapidly improve their precision.\n\n&gt;In his speech before the UN General Assembly last month, Netanyahu warned about Iran and Hezbollah\u2019s effort to build production lines for installing the components at several sites in Beirut, including an underground compound beneath a soccer stadium and one adjacent to the airport. It\u2019s quite possible that Israel will soon take further public measures to expose Hezbollah\u2019s plans.\n\n&gt;In response to Netanyahu\u2019s UN speech, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech at a rally that he\u2019d had enough of the Israeli reports and that from now on, he would not comment publicly on accusations about Hezbollah\u2019s moves.\n\n&gt;The Iranian focus on smuggling efforts directly to Lebanon is occurring in tandem with a certain decline over the past month in smuggling via Syria territory. Israel isn\u2019t ruling out the possibility that the change is due to a Russian directive in wake of the incident in which the Russian plane was shot down. This development could reflect an attempt by Moscow to set new rules of the game in Syria and to reduce the friction between Israel and Iran there as part of the effort to stabilize Assad\u2019s rule.""To live in a world where women and children and the elderly are brutalized by war, there is no greater evil.\nDamn these evil mother fuckers.""Sure most of their missions are flown in outdated and in cases poor condition aircraft but considering everything saying the SyAF has no ability is just wrong.""Why would a respectable professor like T.Postol agree to debate a couch-potato blogger like Higgins?

I would be concerned if people fighting with me are showing up dead and we don't know who is doing it.""I think they're just sectarian and thought Saddam was as sectarianism as they were. I don't understand.\n\nRemember how Hamas back peddled in their support for the rebels last summer?""I am gonna sound cynical atm, But IMO this is bad for your average Syrian.          \nyou probably thinking now, why would he say that? Workshops provide work for people, more people working is good right?                  \nSyrian textile is cheap but bad in quality While neighboring Turkey has a good and cheap textile industry, Syrians IMO should focus on more industries, not go back to the pre-war industry.       \nSyria is already in kind of peace with Turkey, They should export Turkish textiles (like much of the region is doing anyway). It is the same price for the average Syrian, It is better in quality.""Damn, is he blinded in one eye?\nI really hope his captors don't execute him, no love lost for those who use child soldiers to achieve their agenda.\nBetter to surrender than destroy the seeds to your future.""As if Assad was firing those shells himself.\nThey're called retaliatory strikes for a reason.""Yepp, we have seen it a million times before. ""No, the US would probably bomb the SAA if it went  east of the Euphrates.""More regime change efforts, yikes.""Israel will not stop attacking Syria... They can easily find a new way for them to operate... Spies and sabotaging comes to my mind now... ""Quick question, did the US military ever sell Iraq TOW's before obama pulled out?""That was a huge fucking mistake, they should of taken Assad's deal on Afrin. ""Does Iran or Syria have a group of people who hunt down political dissidents around the world?""Are dogs looked at like pigs are to muslims?""Okay, I might be really wrong, but the dogs movements seem a bit, unnatural, puppeteered, at second 20. Not to mention the weird noises the dog makes. It is totally illogical for him to do this from any standpoint. That being said, if this is real, that is awfully gruesome and inhumane, and he should be punished for it.""This guy is worse than isis... How do we know he is SAA soldier ? Wearing military camo means nothing...""Well the title says he Syrian soldier, he could very well be... But I don't see anything to confirm that he is SAA... ""Happy cake day to you too. LOL""Someone would have reported it, this is just some face saving ""I wonder what israel is afraid of, they said the S-300 is nothing to them.""Because they didn't choose to exist.""Probably HTS.\nI doubt any party except for Turkey care for the agreement.""I lack the intelligence to convince you why it's imperative to look after and integrate rape babies into society other than the fact that they're human too.\n\nDamn you and damn myself for not being clever enough. ""The state  should be.""Yes, apparently  they're  as good as Mossad. I doubt they care since they aren't in Syria.""So they basically  want to try and buy out his regime?""Is it working?""wait, I have seen/smelled a burned body, it is definitely not like pork &gt;_&lt;""Bruh with respect to dead people, It smells like burning plastic and shit, Slightly only like cooked meat. ""Mashallah akhi, We should talk more about human flesh later :D.""A big shout out to you and all the others who decided to click and see what the images look like. \n\nI used to be able to click, but now I am at a point where I just want to get over this shiI.""They still exist?""Sadly Denmark is participating along with NATO and EU in terms of sanctions against Syria that only hurt and harm the civilians.  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-sanctions/syria-sanctions-indirectly-hit-childrens-cancer-treatment-idUSKBN16M1UW\n\n"
