storing the contents of milling machines, milling products, and stopping them by stopping the arrival of wheat to the mill after the seizure of all warehouses in all areas under the control of the liberation of the Levant.\n\n- storming the bakery and the inventory of its contents and seizure and prevent the sending of revenues to its administration in Idlib.\n\nIn a related context, an armed patrol affiliated with the Liberation of Sham invaded the bakery in history and seized its financial treasure and arrested its director, engineer: Ahmed al-Qudour for several hours and released him after the intervention of a number of revolutionary figures.\n\nAlso storming the offices of the General Administration in Idlib and inventory the contents of the financial fund and take the data of employees within the institution and centers and mills and furnaces affiliated to them and put guards on the door of the institution and prevent access to enter into the silos in the northern countryside of Idlib and the seizure of contents from Akmen.\n\nThe General Establishment for Grain was founded in the sixth month of 2014 from a group of engineers dissidents of the Syrian regime and worked to secure the Syrian flour for the furnaces in the liberated north at a subsidized price and has worked to develop itself to expand its work to include a number of mills and recently a number of Ovens with a number of workers exceeding 200 workers.\n\n****\n\n\u062d\u0643\u0648\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0642\u0627\u0630 \u0648\u0628\u062f\u0639\u0645

Or having fleet of stealth shaped aircraft, when in the relatively near future it will be all about the inducted electromagnetic or plasma absorption field/shield... etc.     \nIn other words, all they have to do is to invest in research and science, and maintain current technological advantages in all those fields.\n\nBecause, in just one or two decades, the US will confront much different foe from Russia - namely China, which can beat the US and Russia combined, in both economical and quantity weapon race. And sadly, the only possible true allay for the US in that future confrontation is being alienated because of shortcoming domestic political needs.\n""What do you mean?""They've both been shelling each other, not like government has been passive.

In essence their model of defense industry is some kind of China-European hybrid model of state owned or control for defense critical institution. \n\nThat is why when someone on the West is comparing (analyzing) military budgets make usual mistakes: They simple do not recognize 'hidden' inputs, for example salary of research (scientific) personnel and development programs, because they are *not* in official military budget, unless it is for final field testing which request additional personnel. Also, you do not see expenditure for medical insurance and services or for education of military personnel or even for some resources like fuel for tanks LoL\n\n&gt; because a conflict with the United States is unwinnable for them.\n\nThat is main point of our misunderstanding - Russia do not want to win, to be precise, they even do not want conflict at all. The US is one who needs to 'win' and 'success'. Because, the US economy is based on liberal capitalism of 19th century stile. \nSo, the US is one which need to have control of the world economy, in order to assure stable political and economic system.  And to have arch enemy to justifies that hidden expansion. Without control and military might, the US will not be in position to maintain favorable position in trade or production. So, any future denial (by China), will also lead to economic and institutional problems. \n\nRussia do not need that - by the very existence they control enormous mass of land and sea, with all possible and needed resources. And that land mass is more than enough to support and self sustain Russia, even in the total isolation. \n\nThat is why many expert in sustaining civil economy and military industries, see sanctions against Russia, as the most excellent stimulative process for Russia - and we all see results: They are rebuilding local economy in industry relying on their own resources, with no need to rely on foreign investments or technology or resources. It is slow process, but they are already making growth and stable increase in economy output. That positive industrial growth and diversity in economy, would not be achieved without stimulation by sanctions. Irony, isn't it? Or just someone's stupidity...

Syria is in a civil war because Syrians don't have the ability to live together peacefully.""Yeah I'm sure the gazillions of sectarian militias on both sides paints a different picture. To fix a problem, one needs to accept there is a problem. Syrians, especially Sunnis, are not capable of living in a society where their sect is not the dominant one.""It would also be relevant to look at demographics and cultural values of rural populations especially on the Syria-Iraq border. I think it can be a difficult aspect to fully appreciate for people with exclusively \"Western\" background, because supporting a group like ISIS seems unfathomable, yet they were able to find sufficient local support in some tribal areas and along parts o the Euphrates, but not in areas like Latakia. \n\nThis is separate from some of the protests that happened around the Arab spring. A challenge for your  paper will be recognizing that there were multiple conflicts that happened in the same time period, but things coalesced and many original goals became obfuscated as the realities of a protracted, multifaceted civil war took its toll. You may wish to simply acknowledge some of these things rather than fully dissecting all of them depending on the scope and length of your assignment.\n\nThe role of Twitter and online social media would also be a neat thing to talk about""Strawman.\n\nI didn't say all Sunnis are the same. Most Sunnis are this way and that's what's causing the problem. Other sects, as a response, are also this way because of fear of what might happen to them. \n\nFYI, this is how science operates. You make generalizations based on empirical data. It doesn't mean that generalization holds true in every single case. ""No that's not the problem.

That is my opinion too, but main obstacle is Putin and his circle, believe it or not. For them, it is imperative to improve domestic production and personal wealth of Russian people.\n \nSo when you are looking at amount of military budgets, Russia is with estimated 4,3 % of budget spending (as a share of GDP) on 9th place in the World:       \n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditure_share_of_GDP \n\nor in absolute amount:\n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures\n\nBut, if one look at different statistic - *military expenditure per capita* - Russia's spending is well below many other countries:     \n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditure_per_capita \n\nSo, are we looking at confusing statistic? Especially, when there is more reliable Index (IMHO), which represent 'true' military importance/influence on that society, and (to some point) readiness for the war as society for these states in the list.        \nOne can see that 1st place is held by Israel. Narrowly below is Russia, on the 2nd place, although I do personally believe that Russia is more militarized than Israel (by the military influence and share in industry):      \n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Global_Militarization_Index\n\nLet me go back to my first remark - Putin's (circle) influence:       \nMany believe, that from Putin's point of view, true Blue Navy is not needed as deterrent and even in the case of war, this kind of Navy will have no major influence on Russian defense capability. Basically, he and his circle, do not see any advantages in controlling sea routes or projecting force thru Navy at all - except submarines, as part of nuclear triad. \n\nSo, he is the one that actually did stop aircraft carrier program, as not important in new Russian doctrine - which basically is pure defensive one, with strong deterrents in form of nuclear triad.    \nThat said he is pushing projects of smaller war-ships with some high-sea capability - i.e. larger littoral/patrol ships in from of frigates and corvettes.      \nSo, he made 'compromise' with Russian Navy - they will not have nuclear aircraft carrier in foreseen future, but will receive new nuclear cruisers (i.e. ~~Leader~~ Lider-class), as supporting capital ships to frigate/corvette/submarine fleets, especially in the Arctic. \n\nThe Syria intervention is example of this new doctrine: Few supporting ships, 2-4 Air Force squadron and few battalions of ground forces as support. That is all. If hosting (allay) countries is not alone capable to wage war, Russia will not 'help' (intervene), because it is useless (i.e. like Vietnam, Afghanistan... etc.). So, the Russia will intervene abroad in only few cases&gt;\n\n- if small detachment will prevail and turn balance of forces on the battlefield in favor of Russia and her allay,\n\n- if fundamental interest in mainland defense is corrupted - i.e. like loosing Crimea and thus, Black Sea Fleet home base, thus exposing Southern Russia. \n\nIn that light, war in Donbas or Georgia is just to creating belt of dynamic distraction and buffer zone between potential 'foe' (i.e. NATO) and mainland defense. This differs from ex-Soviet doctrine, where and the buffer zone was held by Soviet troops. With 'rebels' forces as buffer, Russia retain possibility of denial, even and to retreat if it is necessary, without dragging major military assets in to the conflict. The same thing, which the US is now doing with SDF/MC in Syria.  \n  ""&gt; All the talk of sarin or chlorine gas, or some obscure nerve agent, but thermobaric bombs are the most terrifying and destructive.\n\nYup, one is fully consciousness to the very end, dying of asphyxiation or burns - unless he was lucky to be blown away in explosion. There is no coincidence, that this weapon is called 'flamethrower' or nick named 'Sun-burn'...""/u/aan8993uun, do not shitpost. Rule 9.

Unlike elsewhere in Iraq where reconstruction is slowly happening, in Sinjar it never even started. Meanwhile Sunni Muslim neighbours are afraid to return, fearing reprisals from community members or local security forces.\n\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council is releasing interviews with Yazidi survivors from Sinjar.\n\n\u201cThree years since the retaking of Sinjar from Islamic State group, this place is still a ghost town,\u201d said NRC\u2019s media coordinator in Iraq, Tom Peyre-Costa, who collected the interviews. \u201cStreets are empty, you barely see anyone. Hundreds of thousands of Yazidis are still displaced across the country and cannot come back because of security issues and also because of the lack of basic services such as water and electricity. There is an urgent need to rebuild schools and hospitals otherwise this place is going to stay empty.\u201d\n\nNRC\u2019s needs assessment in Sinjar found that it urgently lacks health centres, schools and security.

This is the second longer style interview with HTS affiliated persons this week.""They make a ton of unsubstantiated claims, and it reads like neocon wish fulfillment propaganda. \n\nLets take a look at this\n\n&gt;The most important strikes on pro-Russian targets were the assassination of General Issam Zahreddine on 18 October 2017 \u2013 the Syrian regime claimed it was due to a landmine explosion \u2013 and the killing of a Russian officer in June 2018. In both cases, Russia accused Iran of being behind the attacks\n\nThere is literally no evidence of any of this. None. And the article gives none. This is projection and supposition. Its unbecoming of an academic article. \n\n&gt;after Iranian-aligned militias that had previously controlled the river crossings were expelled from the area\n\nThree Hezbollah fighters were killed in a crossing attack near Abu Kamal last week. So this is false as well. \n\n&gt;Iran, by contrast, has directed its energies into spreading its influence through religious doctrine\n\nLaughable. Iran is fighting. Its influence comes at the end of the barrel of a gun. Everything else is secondary. \n\n&gt;By contrast, Iranian interventions did not carry this kind of international legitimacy, to the extent that Iran even denies having military bases inside Syrian territory.\n\nWhat does it matter? \n\nThis article is laughable opinion masquerading as something academic. This is an anti-iranian hit piece. ""I think you are misusing assassination. Assassination isn't really applicable on a battlefield. No one says \"22 ISIS were assassinated assaulting SDF positions\". Its improper regarding the context. \n\nAssassinating usually means specific targeting. Issam was killed by a mine on Saqr island, as were dozens of others. It was a battlefield death, not a targeted strike. ""This seems like a poor reading on the history of the Taliban and foreign intervention in Afghanistan. It also ignores similar stagnation of the SAA with remaining ISIS pockets while overestimating the USAs ability to effectively eliminate asymmetrical groups that have local support by using proxy forces with questionable moral and training.""Well we banned all the bots that correct spelling mistakes so I would probably have continued making this error unless you said something.""Camopedia's Syria page is a start, although it hasn't been updated recently. There's a plethora of units and subunits which basically purchase their own uniforms and equipment, making it hard to have a definitive guide. \n\nThe ranks haven't really changed, but it might be easier just to link the photo so that posters who are more familiar with the SAA/NDF would be able to help.\n\n""It will end soon...right around the time that they can pressure Iran into collapsing. ""Partially right.  Most of the European refugees are African, not Syrian or Iraqi.\n\nRebuilding Syria would prevent Syrian refugees, but not halt the overall trend.""Seems to vary by unit. There's a basic woodland BDU but in the field there are photos of SAA in Russian and Iranian camouflage, Multicam, and even German flecktarn. ""That's misleading - one of the bigger moves Assad made was to end a decades long state of emergency and to release thousands of political prisoners, a move that was popularly called for at the time that rebel sympathizers have subsequently spun as a malicious plan to discredit the opposition. \n\nMind you, the regime was also detaining many and there was armed suppression, but that was not applied in a consistent manner in 2011.  There was a carrot and stick approach that was originally used because the regime was fully cognizant of what was happening in other uprisings in the Middle East at the time. What tends to be glossed over in the narrative is that there were elements of the opposition (particularly the MB and the jihadis) who never intended to negotiate because they loathed the regime, and they are no less important to understanding why the protests devolved into violence.

And the rest shows where the US's initial bargaining stance begins. Trump wants to negotiate and this is an overplay (regime change) in order to settle for what he wants (less Iranian influence near Israel). Another example of this is \"Build the wall and Mexico will pay for it\". Mexico pay for it is an overplay and simply building a wall is the settle. \n\n2. \n \n&gt; Which contributed greatly to the rise of ISIS in the first place in 2013, 2014. \n\nThis part is the polarizing truth that accompanies the aforementioned veiled message. It's meant to distract and reinforce the idea that Assad's regime is untrustworthy in nature. \n\nAssad's regime released islamists that went on to lead extremists in ISIS, Ahrar, JaI, and Nusra, and JAA. They focused mainly on moderates around Damascus, Homs, and Aleppo while allowing the extreme groups (including ISIS) to gain clout, supplies, manpower, and territory. The sentiment of extremism and anti-Regime thinking also was a byproduct of increased Iranian influence in Syria. Rural and more religious sunni's have a deep mistrust of Shiite Iranians. I've always found it interesting that the moderate more urbanized factions of Sunni Syrian society allied with rural Syrians looking to push religious extremism over a more secularized society. \n""The tweet is more referencing the growing Iranian influence over Assad's regime which in turn led to great suspicion among rural Sunni's in Syria. ""1st Coastal Division was based out of Latakia and they received a fair bit of weapons and training from coalition forces.  Could also have been the red bands who are fighters mostly from the Maldives who trained with Malhama Tactical.\n\nCould also be dumb luck on the side of the rebels.  At this point it's hard to know for sure unless you or someone you trust is on the ground. ""The attacks are occasional enough to give the rebels good time for preparation in terms of reconnaissance and planning. They've also been mostly sheltered from heavy government shelling and airstrikes. ""&gt; Assad's regime released islamists that went on to lead extremists in ISIS, Ahrar, JaI, and Nusra, and JAA\n\nLets dive into this a bit. \n\nMost members of the SNC were former political prisoners who were released from prison. Are they 'extreme salafists' now?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suheir_Atassi - arrested in 2011 but now free, ie released\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riad_Seif - arrested 2008 and then again arrested May 2011 but now free... ie released twice\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moaz_al-Khatib - imprisoned multiple times\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Jarba - formerly imprisoned, now released\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamal_al-Labwani - detained pre war, later released\n\nThe prisoners, 260 here for example, contained a wide swathe of people, ranging from lawyers, students, journalists, preachers, and a healthy majority of islamists. It was requested by the public. \n\nA quote from the article:\n\n&gt;\u201cThere is a kind of anger and tension,\u201d said Abd el-Karim Rihawi, the head of the Syrian Human Rights League. Assad must implement reforms immediately, Rihawi added. \u201cHe has some time, and I think it will control the anger of the people.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s a good start,\u201d Rihawi said.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/syrias-assad-moves-to-allay-fury-after-security-forces-fire-on-protesters/2011/03/26/AFFoZDdB_story.html?utm_term=.e1610fb42f39\n\nAnother user pointed this out\n\n&gt;That does not excuse the degree to which ISIL/pre-split Nusra* was tolerated by both rebel forces and their supporters. In other words: OK, it was a trap, but they didn't have to fall for it so enthusiastically. \n\n&gt;It wasn't Assad who welcomed Julani in Syria, or cheered for ISIL-led offensives in Eastern Syria, or called them \"opposition victories\" in press releases when they succeeded.\n\n&gt;It wasn't Assad who painted ISIL-dominated regions green on maps as late as January 2014, and enthused about inevitably incoming rebel victory (of which we now know in hindsight daeshis would have to be a large part) right until ISIL backstabbed the other groups.\n\n&gt;It wasn't loyalist forces that suffered massive defections to ISIL, doubling its manpower, and it wasn't Assad who tolerated and downplayed the influx of Chechens, Uzbeks, Uyghurs and other exotic volunteers while simultaneously feigning outrage at the presence of fellow Arabs from neighboring countries on the opposing side. \n\n&gt;Finally it wasn't Assad who engaged in ISIL apologist (\"they are just a tiny fraction of rebel forces\", \"they kill far fewer civilians than Assad\", \"they just came here to help and will dissolve after rebel victory\") when questioned about them.\n\n&gt;If islamists were indeed released by Assad in a grand conspiracy to discredit the revolution, that would mean that virtually every currently existing rebel group of any significance is the result of Assadist manipulation. If so, then why do you guys support them? \n\n&gt;Either the revolution is generally Islamist and currently existing rebel groups are OK, in which case Assad's amnesty did not fundamentally alter the character of the revolution, or it did, in which case you guys are cheering for militia groups shaped by Assad's evil influence. You can't have both.\n\nAgain, as explained elsewhere, the Islamist fervor was a big part of why Islamists were released. \n\n&gt;  There was a notable islamist trend amongst protestors and their demands for political prisoner release included islamists such as the infamous Zahran Alloush. There were sectarian chants at the beginning of the protests, see this video which includes calls of allegiance to Adnan al Ar'our, a sectarian Saudi wahhabist preacher who endorses genocide of religious minorities.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-crisis-rebels-idUSBRE89A0Y920121011\n\nMy dude, Assad doesn't have a clairvoyant space brain. The whole argument that Iran or Assad created ISIS is both comically ridiculous and totally devoid of evidence, and totally ignores the VITAL role the U.S. had in fermenting the conditions for the rise of ISIS. \n\nWithout the U.S's meddling, ISIS would not exist. That is a fact. \n\nIll leave with this quote\n\n&gt;The opposition was free to shun this sort of people, but didn't, so the whole situation could just as well be spun as \"Assad released Islamists from prisons to prove that his opponents have **no moral qualms about working with extremists**""It doesn't endorse HTS per say. It does however somewhat brush over the very real problem of jihadists and foreign extremists. \n\nIt does however equate Syria to the Rwanda/Congo Wars, which isn't really applicable. It also doesn't go into details. Or give any ideas on how to implement his plan. \n\nIts vanilla generic nothing. We've seen a lot of this already. It adds nothing to the discussion of substance. Its moral grandstanding which we've seen since 2011. ""Not at all - both (SAK &amp; Turkey) still have their proxies on the ground. One can even say that all SAA opponent are better armed today (in means of quality) then they were before. \n\nThat said, Influx of older ex-USSR weapons did decline, but they were already saturated with weapons - so, what they do receive now is more modern ATGM, tech/recce/comm gear, medics, food... etc. and of course shipments of ammunition. Also in Idlib-groups possession are seen and modern China weapons - including and MANPADS - for which delivery is accused Pakistan and some other Asian Muslim states, like Indonesia...   \n\nIn general, there are two main route for supplies: For Idlib groups it is obviously thru Turkey - by Turkey and other Muslim Countries or MB supporters (like Pakistan and Indonesia in first place). And for SDF (both Kurdish YPG and Arab Military Councils) it is thru Iraq - mainly by the US/NATO, but and from other CJTF\u2013OIR members, or from states that are supporting that coalition.      \n\nThird, no less important channel is still via smugglers, although their activity thru SAA held territories (via Jordan and Lebanon) is in sharp decline. But routes from Kuwait via Jordan or Anbar desert are still operational.\n\n   ""Maybe, but more probable outcome is that without hostages as shield, they were simple bombed and obliterated.""They've had seven years of almost nonstop practice. \n\nMost crews probably know their guns like the back of their hands. ""&gt; Anyone who believes sunnis would fight sunnis\n\nThe majority of those killed in the SAA are Sunnis. The intra rebel conflicts are sunni. ISIS was sunni. \n\nThis isn't blaming Sunnis.

They are clearly not fine with it. \n\nNuclear Power is also incredibly capital and time intensive to start. Solar is cheaper and much quicker.

The pilot of F-22 become aware of Su-35, only after they 'pop-up' in their tail. And even then AEW&amp;C wasn't able to 'see' them.\n\nSo, Su-57 will be just test platform for new fighters and technologies, but even that role is not guarantied for Su-57 - because it is only supersonic, atmospheric concept. \n\nSimple said, this fighter come too late to be deployed. But, as his production is far cheaper (in means of mass series) because of composite materials, than classical 'all-metal', it is possible that some new version will saw limited production (up to a hundred or two, at most, IMHO).\n \nSo, instead of developing bulky and clumsy 5th generation, Russia is preparing 6st generation of hypersonic fighters, which are planed to be operational as early as 2025-2030. \n\n""It is spherical or other geometrical add-ons which artificially enlarge radar cross section of given object, so one will have false reading - meaning, true radar (stealth) cross section is hidden. \n\nBut that have influence only on short wave (i.e. X-band like) radars, and does not have any effect on true long wave radar cross section. \n\nFor example F-22 (with reflectors or not), on long wave or ultra short wave like LIDAR have 'echo' related to his size - shape and material do not have any stealth effect at all. Even to the contrary - on simple meteorological radar they shine like Christmas tree... LoL""Second - geometrical/material (i.e. shaped/absorption) stealth is obsolete concept.""I'm not seeing the 3/4 figure. That's what I am doubting. Is that from somewhere or is it your figure?\n\nAnd I mean more along the lines of Mosul, as the Siege of Raqqa was a different beast all together. ""What do you know about plasma and EM absorption? Or DARPA research on 'cold plasma'?\n\n\n\n""Link&gt;     \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_stealth""Liwa al-Fatemiyoun is a foreign militia fighting for the government side, some Iraqi militias are also present.""In 1999 Serbian air defense accidentally stumble on and then compare  data from operating meteorological radars and some older long-wave radar, used for over-horizon detection. \n\nThen they used 'rudimentary network' of radar transmitters (even 'decoy' emitters) and receivers, and achieved enough precision to launch S-125 'Neva' in that area. And missile seeker with large fragmentation did the job on F-117A. After that, at least 2 more F-117A was damaged in the same way.\n\nWhen I mentioned 'rudimentary network', it is because they did not have enough computing power for real time analysis and the network of transmitters (and emitters) was more or less, simple pile-up. Although this give just more or less, accidentals results, other military was extremely interested in applied method. \n\nAnd today, after almost 30 years of research and developing, when one look at modern layered architecture of air-defense, one can see that this conception of multiple transmitters/emitters, passive receivers, coupled with IR/UV and sound detectors, can give extremely precise picture of moving objects in the air and their 3D position. \n\nHere is basic article of this method (and other, btw.):      \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_technology#Radar_stealth_countermeasures_and_limits\n\nSo, age of one antenna transmitter &amp; receiver is gone. Thus, any air frame shaped for LO (low observable) with or without absorption skin, is even more visible in certain band and direction of reflected radiation, then common aerodynamic air frame. \n\nOf course, this type of frame used against low-technology military is still valuable assets. But as the investing in radar/observation network and grid, is today relatively chip (comparing to prize of just one air frame), and the prize of needed computing power - one can understand why this approach in LO technology is obsolete.""No one knows how many Turkmen are in Syria, much less now that so many have been displaced.

""&gt; I'm sorry if I've ruined anyone's dreams of flying around completely undetected or ruined your opinion of your respective governments honesty in regards to their stealth capabilities. \n\nYou got me all wrong. I do not claim that this is 'real deal' in Syria - all talks was why Russian did abandon (supposedly) Su-57 concept. Btw. It was not mentioned here, but that is also, IMHO, why and the US stopped production and development of F-22/23 family fighters.  \n\nMy arguments (or better to say - arguments that was given to me, which I do accepted...) is that shape/material LO technology is obsolete because of few major development&gt;     \n\n- First, development of multi layered grid of networking sensors (land/air/space/sea) which combined give real time awareness of the flying objects, including and those with LO shape/material design (i.e. stealth),   \n- Second, development of other means - 'cold plasma' is just one of potential research and development which is actually working. In case of Russian claims, this -20 dB plasma-shield is news from 1999. So, they (and surely other military), did have almost 20 years to exploits and develop this.      \n- Third, and most important difference between shape LO technology and active absorption/attenuation - second technology work uniformly in almost all direction and in wider spectrum...\n\nLet's say (for the sake of argument) that those results were 10 time smaller, so, it is let's say -10 dB of reflecting radiation - even that is huge developments if this will work with any shape and material/skin air frame. But if they really achieved working attenuation in range of - 20 dB then everything is clearer, why the US did not produce or continuing to produce F-22, and Russia (and India) will not invest any more in Su-57 (T-50) \n\n/Remarks      \nbtw. I have heard rumors that actual experimental achievement in combined ionized / high-frequency-polarized skin (or integrated frame - I did not understand working principle very well...) and it is in range of -30 to -35 dB (which then is translated in ~1.000 to 2.500 smaller relative RCS), with peak result of more than -40 dB (which is more than ~10.000 smaller RCS). \n\n*EDIT:*     \n*In all you wrote, I do not find anything contradictory to my personal view or anything with what I will disagree.* \n\n ""Sarcasm is Haram bro! /s\n\nGotta add that /s.

The pilot of F-22 become aware of Su-35, only after they 'pop-up' in their tail. And even then AEW&amp;C wasn't able to 'see' them.\n\nIt was mentioned more like anecdote, but those incident did happen - believe it or not. \n\nWhat was the reason: F-22 was in fully passive mode (or just known weakness of F-22 - limited observability in rear hemisphere), ultra low flight approach with EW/jammer support or EM shield, it is to be seen. Also, Syria is testing ground for Russia, contrary to the US, they do not have other opportunity to test their hardware against Western hardware. So, this is maybe from our perspective, not very wise, because this way they reveal their research and developments. Let's assume that in those incidents, Su-36S did use some kind of -20to30 dB 'shield', in low speed/low level approach, that can explain why it was possibly to be mistakenly identified as some other, not true threat vehicle.\n\n&gt; The Russian's did not abandon the Su-57, they made it very clear it was various news organizations that took the fact they were not placing new orders until the next generation engines were completed to mean Russia gave up on it.\n\nI read those 'news' and also this how's the Su-57 (then it was T-50), still can not achieve supersonic without usage of after-burner. But, as you know, since 2014, Su-35S with 'Saturn AL-41F1S' (i.e. modification of 'Saturn Al-41F' - Izdeliye 117S), do have supercruise ability at around Mach 1.5. \n\nAs the Su-57 have more refined aerodynamic design and use more powerful 'Saturn AL-41F1' (Izdeliye 117) with trust around 90-100 KN (dry), they do have native supercruising capability. \n\nSo, there will be in maximum 2 squadrons of Su-57 (including and flying prototypes), which all will be used as testing platforms. If that is not abandoning, then what is?\n\n&gt; It would be ready around the time of 6th generation aircraft if they go all out on the subject. That would mean not producing functional fifth generation aircraft would be a massive mistake. That would be like not building a trebuchet because you're heard rumors of gunpowder, the canon that could destroy walls is still centuries away at that point.\n\nSo what is this story about future (Izdeliye 30) engine? Supposedly this engine will give around 120 KN dry trust and more than 180 KN with afterburner - thus, many suspect that this engine was not in development for Su-57, but for some other air frame. \n\nBecause of that enormous afterburner trust - this is suspected to be result of ability to use closed chamber (i.e. rocket principal), which is needed if that air frame will have near-space maneuver capability and Mach 5+ speed. Anyway, that air frame (6th gen.) will be supposedly operational in 2025. That is very close - so why will Russia spent time/money/resources on Su-57 full production, when they may achieve that huge jump with 6th generations? I suppose that this is gamble, but they (as anyone else) will have to make this jump eventually, so sooner may become better.\n\n&gt; so it is in a very small scale testing most likely under optimal conditions. \n\nTrue, or better to say 'possible' - it is something which was told to me by my 'friend' ex-'foe' LoL (now retired as I am, so we're all buddies now). As I did (supposedly) understood:     \nThe frame or part of inner skeleton of the air frame is polarized (how, I did not understand well), and the skin (or above the airframe skin) in interaction with emitters and this polarized skeleton, develop ionized layer, which is used to attenuate EM reflection. As the rate (frequency) of polarization can be changed, that is used to adopt that 'shield' to radar frequency. Or environment. Because, supposedly, side effect is in aerodynamics, as that allow better 'thru air' penetration - like in case of supercavitation in the water. Also, side effect is and lower IR signature, due to reduction in air-to-frame friction.""&gt; In practice, most of the time you need something portable. That means it's power supply needs to move with it. The amount of power that can be supplied and remain portable is limited. \n\nIf it is in passive mode or just receiving antenna, you do not need that amount of power supplies. \n\nAlso, they do not need any protection. \n\nAs emitters (which is different from transmitters), one can use any other EM emitter - for example, civil or TV or Radio broadcast, or even from known Satellite broadcast. \n\nAll one is need to have this grid of receivers networked to computing nod or center, which will give 'picture' to command center and fire solution.\n\nForget about installation which is all-in-one transmitter/receiver - the best analogy, is instead of using one powerful reflector, one can light any space with many and different smaller (also and different color) source of light. And that will give even better obesrvability, and better 3D positioning.\n\nOnly condition for that was computing power and network - sources of all band of EM radiation are all over the planet anyway. All you need is enough chip and passive receivers.""What the hell why am I blocked by this guy""The UAE reportedly did a decent job in South Yemen with regards to taking Aden and driving the Houthis out of the area.

With external relay (air/land/sea/space) this range is practically unlimited. \n\nHere is links to 'L' band portable radar, which is also capable as passive point in network&gt;     \npicture: http://roe.ru/upload/resize_cache/iblock/bda/1200_900_1e3cd68611aa859771f9d287689e58ce0/bdade2a90f997877baa6c435bcaf9ad7.jpg     \ndata: http://roe.ru/eng/catalog/air-defence-systems/radar-and-electro-optical-equipment-for-air-target-detection/1l122-1e/     \n\nNotice the size (~1 m2), weight (~150 Kg), power (800 W max.)...\n\nBasically, the only defense for 'target' is to fly 'silently' and to rely on passive IRST/VLST/UVST (infra-red, visible light, ultra violet) systems, which highly reduce stand-off capability (from few hundred to max. 50 Km) and put target in range of even middle range SAMs.""They are part of NATO and CJTF-OIR.

It seemed mostly dead, and then joined the NFFL. \n\nI remember looking them up after the Abu Duhur campaign, cause I figured so large a group would play a big role in the fighting and all I could find was a video of a couple technicals firing.

You'd look at the photos and conclude that nothing is being repaired, but they repair, modify, and restore a ton of armor. \n\nThe argument was also raised that by 2012 a lot of the various armor stockyards around the country were being hurriedly rushed to safer areas as well. I think lionofbanyas promoted that idea. \n\nAdditionally, a lot of those tanks in photos are reports look like they hadn't ever seen combat, and were in an absolute state of decay, which also lends credence to that theory. \n\nBUT. Jakob could be totally right. My point is that looking at google earth and counting ATGM strikes will not give you an accurate or complete view of the situation. \n\nAs for a backlog, i'd buy that. But its clear that the facilities are running, but to what extent is totally unknown. ""&gt; maybe the rows of engine blocks speaks otherwise to that\n\nA lot of yards do repairs in series to maximize efficiency. They may have ten tanks that need new engines, so they pull those aside until they can run a series on them. Same with barrels, ext ext ext. \n\nThose engines look like they are either scrapped from old tanks, new imports, or are freshly scrubbed. And most of the photos show dudes working on engines. Hell, it might be the purpose of that particular part of the facility. \n\nWe just dont know. ""&gt; European gas needs can only really be met by Iran or Russia\n\nWell, it is myth: \n\nEU need to import about 50% of their need for the gas and Russia is supplying only around 35% of that import needs or roughly one quarter of total EU consumption of gas. In total energy production in EU, the Russian gas participate with around 10%. \n\nSo, EU (in general) do not depend on Russian gas. Also, EU capacity for importing LNG (from the US, for example) is around 250 b cm, and total import from Russia is around 160 b cm. So, if the price is right, EU can switch to LNG in any given time. \n\nBut to the contrary, Russian can not easily switch their export to somewhere else. Because, Russian gas export to EU is almost 90% of their exported gas and 99% is thru pipeline toward EU - thus they (Russian) are those which depend on export in EU. \n\nThat is why the US is trying to make Russian export as hard as it is possible, also because the US is the largest gas producer on the planet and need more market. That is two convenient reason, why the US 'oppose' and spread myth of EU dependencies on Russian gas. \n\nTwo other most loud 'opponent' to Russian gas is Poland (which energy balance is based on Coal, and basically do not need gas) and UK, which is with Norway major supplier of gas for the EU.\n\nSo, the Russian response on the US pressure on the gas market is pipeline to China, but that needs time.\n\nEU production and dependencies is here&gt;     \nhttps://group.atradius.com/publications/economic-research/european-gas-market-outlook-2018.html\n\nand here&gt;       \nhttps://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Natural-gas-demand-in-Europe-in-2017-and-short-term-expectations-Insight-35.pdf\n\n\n\n""&gt;  I know they\u2019re still assisting the Coalition against Daesh though.\n\nThey are not just assisting - they are part of Coalition...
