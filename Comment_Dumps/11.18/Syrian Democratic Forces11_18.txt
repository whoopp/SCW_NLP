There is no threat coming from whole syrian border because the YPG is not dumb enough to risk the whole territory they hold.

Also not learning your language in school.""I recommend looking up the history of Kurds in Turkey. There is a reason why the PKK exists. ""Assad considers Turkish occupation just as bad as US occupation. He was not fine with it.""It's not like you would even accept 1/10th of anything being in kurdish hands. Afrin is majority kurdish. Or better: was majority kurdish until 100 000 people were displaced. Now Turkey will use it to settle arab refugees that aren't even from Afrin there.""The history of Kurds doesn't start with the founding of the PKK. I am not saying that you should be sympathetic towards the PKK or \u00d6calan but ignoring the violations that had been happening even before their founding (and are still happening) is not only dumb but also ignores the reason for this whole conflict. ""Yes and driving out people out of their properties and giving the refugees their houses should be blamed on Turkey. Much point in blaming Turkey here.""Which is why I support the women\u2019s liberation aspect of the DFNS. They\u2019ve made a lot of progress towards that. ""I'm not changing topics, you are misunderstanding me. The guy above said that Turkey wants to settle arabs there which were forced out of kurdish areas which is pretty much bullshit. Of course there were many refugees coming and they were accepted in Afrin (eventhough I don't think that the refugees + native arabs where the majority). The problem is that none of the people that were already living there were forced out of their houses because of this.\n\nWhat Turkey did was pushing out the people who would fear a turkish/arabic rule the most (kurds) by bringing war to them and then occupy their houses and give them to refugees and not give them back when people returned.\n\nSo one was forced demographic change while displacing the native population and the other one was accepting refugees while not displacing anyone. Do you see what the problems with Turkeys actions are?""Source for any of this? What do you delfine as many? 1000 people? 50% of the city?""&gt; most of the locals dislike the SDF and YPG.\n\nSource?""I think that some don't like the SDF because no civilian population is going to love a large military presence in their place of living. Because Raqqa still has many remaining ISIS cells within it's limits, the SDF has a very firm presence within the city and comes across as pretty authoritarian sometimes. I don't personally disagree with this firm presence, as ISIS and other jihadist groups are still carrying out attacks in the city, but to a civilian it could get very stifling. That's my 2 cents.""I think the overuse of heavy munitions in Raqqa was mostly dictated by the US. I very well could be wrong here, but due to the USAF track record of over-bombing targets combined with the YPG not having that much authority over the air strikes this appears to be a issue of US doctrine. But like I said, this could just as likely not be the case.""&gt; Doesn't seem like there's much military objective involved here. \n\nBased on?""Their relationship with the YPG is just as \u201cTemporary and tactical\u201d as the the US\u2019s presence in Syria is \u201ctemporary and tactical\u201d. I see very little reason why the US would drop the YPG just to get on better terms with Erdogan when the YPG provides almost infinite boots on the ground for the US and provides a secure place (the DFNS) for the US to operate out of. There\u2019s almost no one except the SAA who\u2019s fighting ISIS at the moment so it just doesn\u2019t add up to me. ""The US isn\u2019t very concerned with morals it seems ""which is a very important detail ""And how do you know they specifically targeted the civilians...?""[Most of the reports talk about civilians but Rudaw says two of the killed were Peshmerga](http://www.rudaw.net/mobile/english/kurdistan/15112018)""&gt; Still dont get the point of the patrols. \n\nTo make the Turkish voters think something is being done against the \"PKK\"""No you didn't read that right (\"abusive teacher of the Koran\"), the teacher is apparently abusing the Quran and not the students.

This doesn\u2019t indicate any loss of aid or military support.""SDF is a military force that is dominated by the YPG in numbers and equipment, you can\u2019t build up the SDF without building up YPG, which they do appear to be doing ""I don\u2019t see this as alienating, the YPG and PKK are somewhat related, as most people consider them to be.  This is just facts, I don\u2019t see this as alienating or degrading to the SDF. While they do try to play down their PKK connection, you don\u2019t really see them outright denying it ""what step are you referring to?""Strange how they didn't accept the peace treaty from Israel where they would return the Golan then.""Why admit defeat when defeated 3 times?""Have the photos been verified? Why would Al Sura of all websites get access to them first?""ok""To be fair, its just as likely that this was planned in retaliation for the raid on Jaish al-Izza last week.""A single bulldozer making defences now that the SAA-rebel front lines have been reduced tremendously isn't going to make any difference whatsoever especially since ISIS has zero chance of attacking the city.\n\nIt would have been more fitting to hit a more expensive target like a tank or BMP or at least some gathering of soldiers.""Well Israel has bombed Syria several times since ISIS/FSA at the syrian-israeli border have been defeated. So...""&gt;Another dead fighter\n\n&gt;\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0628&lt;\n\nIs the fighting happening in Al Bab too?""why would they give the SAA the border if Turkey has TFSA ready to invade the border areas? This would actually insure invasion not prevent it. Only reason why Turkey hasn\u2019t pushed farther into Syria is because of US presence along the border, if the SAA controlled it then the US and Turkey would have a common goal of invading that border area to remove Assad\u2019s forces. Makes absolutely no sense ""The Hazzm remnants ended up in the Levantine Front and/or the SDF IIRC.""Does their looting know no bounds?""I mean it\u2019s either the SDF gives the border to the SAA, messing up their relationship with the US and possibly losing coalition support by giving a bunch of land to Assad, and then Turkey sending in TFSA to the border, or the SDF keeping the border and then eventually facing an expanded Turkish operation east of the euphrates. Basically neither option is good because the SDF and Assad are both considered high priority enemies by Ankara. Either timeline includes a Turkish or TFSA invasion ""Incredibly heavy for the (few remaining) residents who were \"saved\".""&gt; Syria through years of war is still better off. \n\nHow? That's a very bold claim.""It's almost hard to believe it's not satire, cartoonishly evil.""well that's a war crime\n\nEDIT: I know this isn't actually a huge deal. I've been following the war long enough to know how many war crimes end up happening. Just light sarcasm on my part""Using light sarcasm there but IMO it is pretty bad form to repeatedly stab a wounded soldier on camera no matter what side you're fighting for. A navy seal just got a war crime charge slapped on him for doing the same thing to an IS fighter. It's easy to hold groups like the YPG or FSA to a lower standard for that stuff because they're non-state actors but it's pretty shitty nevertheless. War is hell I guess""The olives that are produced in Afrin aren't directly supplying the PKK. That's beyond absurd. The olives were the property of the farmers who have worked their land for years if not decades, and are the export product that keeps the population of Afrin fed. The situation in Afrin is already very unstable for Turkey and the TFSA, if they want to hold that territory they should at least start by not repeatedly stealing valuable property from it's citizens.""Yup, Kosovo and Bosnia.""Why would he need balls to say it? No one gives a shit about how they defile Afrin. The UN cares more about the US and Russia mistakenly bombing some civilians than an actual ethnic cleansing and colonization.""I should just copy my previous comment it fits well enough: \"It's almost hard to believe it's not satire, cartoonishly evil\"""The war is dragging on as much as Bannerlords development.
