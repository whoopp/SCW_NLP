"**what** exactly happened in Palmyra and when?""How do you 'take' this territory? It's a volcanic wasteland, it doesn't have any roads nor settlements in it. To fully pacify this territory they would have to eradicate IS elements probably hiding in caves, to the last man.\n\n&gt; The Turkish threat is a legitimate reason to pause the offensive.\n\nWhat offensive?? I've been hearing about this supposed SDF offensive for months now yet I compared to the campaigns of 2017 around Raqqa these clashes up until a week ago could be characterized as skirmishes at most.\n""My bad. Russian media makes it seem like everybody in the Russian Army has ratnik gear.""All of them are dead. Give us living currently in power US supported dictators.""They're experienced in doing things the wrong way, they need to be trained to do things the right way. \n\nBy your logic SAA is stronger than US Army because they're more experienced.""&gt; Assad gets his ass kicked by ISIS remnants nonstop in areas like this.\n\nNo \"he\" doesn't. When was the last time ISIS took a town from the SAA? 2017? \n\nAlso, how does Assad get his ass kicked by ISIS? Is Assad rambo? lol.""At least Assad is a Syria nationalist.""Obama left Iraq too early.""Why are Arab armed groups obsessed with flaming hoops?""No he isn't. If that was the case, he would have been gone long ago.\n\nBesides, rebels want an Islamic caliphate, Assad wants a Syria. Tell me who's the nationalist?""\"Massive financial and military support\" wouldn't stop a rogue conscript from gunning him down.\n\nYou listen to too much US propaganda.""https://youtu.be/pAcQHycKALA?t=59\n\nLet me guess, these are Iranians? Dude come on. \n\nIf Assad was truly hated, these guys would have gunned him down.\n\nLess than 30k \"Iranian backed mercenaries\" have fought in Syria. Stop with the Israeli/US propaganda. 100k? Really? Whats next? A million?""https://youtu.be/pAcQHycKALA?t=59""Why would shop owners do that? That's losing profit.""Yeah I\u2019m no businessman. But that makes sense.""So what if there are a few foreign pro gov groups. Doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a million Iranians fighting for Assad \ud83d\ude11""&gt; Many of the victories achieved by Assad were spearheaded by foreign fighters\n\nSince when were the Tiger Forces and 4th Division foreign fighters? \ud83d\ude11""You are the ignorant one. Have you heard of Daraa offensive, battle of Deir ez zor, Issam Zahreddine and Suheil Hassan? Oh yeah you probably think they\u2019re Iranians too.""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rif_Dimashq_Governorate_campaign\n\nThis massive campaign was led almost entirely by regular SAA. This was from the early days to 2018, btw.\n\nYou are overestimating the importance of foreign militias.""So the US prescence hasn't stopped the shelling? Weird.""It's like a cheaper airstrike.""Weird. US soldiers fight way better and they don\u2019t do dumb shit like jumping through flaming hoops. Never knew a professional force like Soviet Army came up with that.""Better a dictator than radical Islamists.""&gt; \"dozens\"? Color me skeptical.\n\nWhy is that? rebels aren't a exactly a professional fighting force. A well done well planned raid by experienced SAA units can easily defeat some rag tag Islamist rebels.""They aren't \"Pro-Assad fighters\" they are SAA soldiers.""Tiger Forces is a light infantry battalion. They have probably 1 or 2 tank companies attached for support. Judging by videos Tiger Forces don't use massed armored formations only a couple tanks for infantry support.""Executed in France??!""Or maybe you know, it might have been SAA units TRAINED and EQUIPPED by RUSSIAN ARMY! \n\nSAA is experienced + have been trained by Russian Army and IRGC. I don't see how a well pulled off raid on poorly trained Islamists couldn't possibly have been done by SAA.""False. Tiger Forces is a battalion in the SAA. Not SyAF, not Air Force Intelligence, it is SAA. ""No.""Are US soldiers \"Pro-Trump fighters\"? No, they are US soldiers.""We say no to another terror state like Taliban controlled Afghanistan pre-9/11.""Perhaps an Iranian backed militia? Doubt ISIS has artillery and doubt SAA would be dumb enough to attack US military.""Short ranged. Would get detected.""Why \"Pro-regime militias\" only? Does SAA not exist?""Do they do a lot of combat or just basically LARPers?""&gt; I heard they lost over a thousand soldiers during the battle for that town\n\nImpossible. If that was true that would mean the entire Tiger Forces was wiped out. Tiger Forces is a battalion sized unit with approximately 1000 men.""&gt; multiple Russians were killed\n\nOf course its not true. \n\na. Russian media would have reported on it already\n\nb. There would have been Russian response (Air strikes and cruise missiles).""No this was back during WWII""There were times when the Tiger Forces lost 100+ men but they were never nearly wiped out. ""Seems like Jordanians treat Syria same way as Canadians USED to (Back when the CAD was stronger than USD) treat US for cheap shopping.""https://fotw.info/flags/iq!2004.html\n\nThis was supposed to be the new Iraqi flag proposed in 2004 during the Coalition Provisional Authority government.\n\nIraqis didn't like it because they thought it looked too similar to Israeli flag.""What exactly could possibly be the purpose of doing handstands at 0:30, then 2 seconds later the guy stands in the middle of the doorway throws in a grenade and just looks at it.""Doesn't matter. Syria has a seat in the UN, some radical Islamist anti-Assad groups don't.""I thought they were fighting for freedom and democracy?""Accuse and abuse??""And they lost.""Yeah you're probably right its most likely dude having fun doing goofy shit. Using slingshots out of desperation in Kobani 2014 would make sense, even then we didn't see anything like that, but in 2018 after all the victories and US support? Doubt it.""Yeah he just looks like a thug/mercenary. There are Sultan Murad members who look full blown (Sorry for the pun) jihadi though. ""SAA infantry beat them.""If SDF actually used their infantry for assaults instead of carpet bombing every little point of resistance, there would have been less destruction.""Becuase SAA withdrew to not be cut off from Damascus.""Air striking large strongholds? Sure. Dropping 500 pound JDAMs on every single building with a few guys with AKs? No that is a waste.\n\n""Tons of alewife men were killed in the war and the alawites aren\u2019t zionists.""Glad someone understands that firepower without maneuver is indecisive.""So? You\u2019re basically saying conscription causes support for your enemy.""Grozny was a massive fuck up. Look at Fallujah for an example of a successful urban battle.""And Afrin campaign was incredibly slow because every little point of resistance had to be air or artillery strikes by TAF.""&gt; What's next, supporting Al Quaeda?\n\nAlready happened. Al Nusra in Syria.""Nice looking cars, 90s/early 2000s style, really like them. Wish I could buy one.""Combat experience is always nice to get.""I mean nice as in creating a more effective fighting force. Not saying experiencing it as an ndividual is nice.""What is the Corrective Movement?""Yeah definitely not result of funding and supplying of various \u201cmoderate\u201d jihadist groups who destabilized Syria enough for ISIS to exploit situation, joined ISIS or dissolved and guess where the weapons went? To ISIS. Not saying USA created ISIS or something silly but blaming the Syrian government for ISIS is ridiculous.""Syria is not Assad\u2019s fault. If anything the blame should be put on CIA/MI6/Mossad for providing heavy support to \u201cmoderate\u201d jihadist groups.""I\u2019ve seen SAA soldiers wearing anything from T shirts and camo wife beaters to Iranian digital camo pattern uniforms.""&gt; Also I can assure you that the Saudi king is way more brutal than Assad. Why isn't he a problem but our president is?\n\nBecause the Saudi medieval style monarchy is allied with the US and Syria isn't. If Assad was allies with US instead of Iran/Russia they would be chill with him just like with Saudi monarchy, King Abdullah of Jordan and other totalitarians.""And then once they're in the field for some reason their uniforms go missing.""Raid which was itself a retaliation for HTS raid on SAA positions.""That is because rebels don\u2019t report their losses. Maybe 40 jihadists were killed in this raid?""Exactly. Some people think government is just arresting innocent people or reconciled rebels who did nothing wrong. ""Who\u2019s other help could Assad get? USA didn\u2019t want to help, neither did Russia at the time.""Epic""Proves that SAA is not \"mostly made up of foreigners\" like some people claim...""Look up /u/kingabdullah and /u/XamarCedey""False.""SAA went down from a strength of about 300 000 in 2011 to around 150 000 in 2015. This is not exclusively defections. SAA lost nearly 100 000 men KIA from 2011 to 2015. This leaves us with 50 000 others lost not necesserally defectors, could be WIA, MIA, and simply deserters. Keep in mind there were replacements so there were many more wounded than KIA.  ""Ikr. They may not admit it but they are sectarians.""Around 70 000 ISIS killed by USA.""What? B-1 bombers, MLRS, M109s and CAESARs dont exist? ""When you win a battle the enemy doesn't necessarily all get slaughtered. When enemy loses cohesiveness and line of defense breaks, they lose.""Yeah but you think it\u2019s sushpishus tht SAA won quickly.""Yes it could have been taken with less destruction. SDF called in airstrikes on every little speck of resistance.""A. Raqqa is bombed to shit\n\nB. During Euphrates campaign, it took SDF on average about 3 months to take a small village\n\nC. No advance in Hajin because SDF doesn't use their ground forces for assault, only to form a (very weak) siege link around Hajin, while USAF bombs the shit out of every house where gunfire came from. This tactic worked previously before Raqqa and after Raqqa the advance became slower and slower using this tactic because ISIS had/has nowhere else to retreat.""Why are they (USA) so worried about Hezbollah? Hezbollah never attacked USA besides the 1983 barracks bombing which wasn't even a terrorist attack.""No dude that\u2019s Assad\u2019s personal tank graveyard.""&gt; imo it's entirely inadequate.\n\nLet me guess, you'd like another neo con war on behalf of Israel.""&gt; regime's inability to adapt\n\nThey adapted, just look at footage from Operation Damascus Steel and Daraa. Definitely late though tbh.""&gt; maybe if countries like Syria and Iran and organizations like Hezbollah didn't keep screwing around with powerful and trigger-happy countries like Israel and the USA, they wouldn't get bombed or have their enemies funded.\n\nBasically what you're saying is, submit to and do not resist against USA and Israel, or else you are a terrorist.""And get replaced by who? Radical Islamists? No thanks.""So is FSA by your logic. Don't see you calling for military intervention against them. ""If they didn't accept COH, they simply would have been destroyed further.""I've only seen a PKM bipod used once in this entire video.""Why SAA? Could have been jihadists firing it at civilians.""Chlorine gas isn't hard to make.""Can mean killed, wounded, or missing yes.""CNN and Fox News is Pro-US/rebel bias circlejerk and Al Masdar and RT are pro-gov circlejerk. Not much better.""What do you suggest? Assad dun it?""&gt; It's not like the regime cares about civilian casualties anyways\n\nDo they have a choice? They don't have the money for precision guided weapons and also they had humanitarian pauses in Ghouta and Aleppo. How is that \"Not caring about civilians\"?""Rebels have used chlorine shells before I don't see why this is hard to believe.""&gt; A rebel gas attack on government held areas has no strategic value for them either.\n\nImplying that fanatics need a reasonable and strategical excuse to attack a place.""Its going down.""&gt; Russia is using their precision guided munitions to target civilians in Syria.\n\nlolno""Exactly, were dealing with religious fanatics who just want to \"fight for allah\" and go to heaven. Doubt they care about their mortal worries such as grand strategy.""He means US is being hypocrites for Tomahawking SAA but when rebels do it its ok.""Should Trump step down because some people told him to? Oh noes hes a selfish monster!""SAA only started shelling \"opposition\" occupied cities in 2012, 1 year after the war began.\n\nIts not like Assad just out of the blue said \"I should shell some civilian areas I'm bored\" one peaceful day. If the US devolved into total civil war Trump would be shelling civilian areas too.""There is no evidence Syrian security forces did that.""Yes they do near Raqqa.""Remember that one time Hezbollah and Iran backed shia militias slaughtered a bunch of Sunni civilians in Syria? Oh wait they never did, unlike sectarian radical Islamist sunni groups.""&gt; So you expect me to believe that over 7 years of war Hezbollah and other Shia militias have never killed a single civilian..... even Nasrallah doesn't believe that.\n\nOn accident? Sure. For sectarian reasons (Which you are suggesting)? No.""&gt; Assad's personal death group\n\nSyrian Air Force Intelligence is closer to the CIA than some \"personal death group\".\n\nAlso you didn't provide evidence that it was Syrian security forces who did it.""&gt; What motive could the rebels possibly have to use cw in this case?\n\nRadical Islam.""&gt; we know he was at an opposition protest\n\nSo? Can jihadists not capture him there?\n\n&gt; we know he was found and we know that when he was found he was filled with bullet holes\n\nJihadists don't have guns?\n\n&gt; other detainees testified that he was captured by the SAI\n\nEyewitness testimonies not enough.""&gt; Why would Jihadis torture a 13 year old sunni boy?\n\nTo false flag and blame the government.""Chemical shells still have HE in them and still do break apart.""Most rebels back then were indeed moderate, but Islamist not-moderate groups like Muslim Brotherhood did have a small prescence, however they were the ones to start shooting on behalf of the opposition.""Artillery is an integral part of the combined arms team. Believe me if there was a high intensity civil war in the US \"Trumps forces\" would be shelling LA too.""You are looking for anything to try and deny the fact that your rebels aren't angels incapable of wrong doing.""And short range. Which would disprove omaronly's false claim that this is \"too close\" to fire chemical weapons.""lol nice one.""You were probably caring when guys exactly like these were doing inghimashi attacks on US soldiers in Iraq.""I mean they aren\u2019t wrong. Saudi Arabia is ISIS lite. If they weren\u2019t US allies or didn\u2019t have oil they would be called a terror state.""Yeah by apparently there was ISIS in YPG controlled Afrin...""Is British SOF actually doing any fighting?""What is it? Im afraid of clicking it.""Why is it so hard to believe SyADF hitting Israeli targets? Remember the F-16 that went down in February? IDF isn't involnurable.""Shooting down \"objects\" can mean stand off missiles too. ""Fire and movement training. Also is that a woman at 1:03 O_o?""You are dead wrong. "
