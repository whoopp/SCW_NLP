""Your comment started sound and thoughtful in the first paragraph then porgressively went to oversimplified and became plain factually wrong by the end. As it was repeated time and again, of course some people sadly experienced disproportionate injustice. In fact, many of us pro-Government Syrians also had our own bad experiences with the administration (may be we got lucky not to have faced the most agressive individuals in the administration). The difference is we observed the people around us climb that socio-economical ladder, we saw how things worked, we became aware of the workings that we don't boil everything down to Assad and his family. It is complete misunderstanding of the situation. May be to you in your country where there is a sharply-defined executive power with clear-cut limitations, it is a straightforward matter as to at what level you can assign blame when it comes to political legislations (except in economic matters which have an inherent  unpredictable character). \n\nIn this crisis, we talk so much about the corruption factor yet the most important about said corruption is very often (intentionally) overlooked: that is the very symptom of corruption-related chaos, it is that everything is done \"under the table\". Why do you think people from third-world countries need to get vetted for their credentials? It's exactly because everything can be forged, more or less easily. This should be easy to understand why in the Syrian system, Assad did not have his hand on everything.\n\nNow you might say, well if the president fails at cracking down on corruption, then may be it's time to try someone else. Sure, but none of the Opposition was convincing because they made the mistake of welcoming and initiating dialogue with such parties as the Muslim Bortherhood and joining together in councils. Taking a look at the streets, remember the video you posted yourself of an activist singing and dancing waving FSA flags along with other people while also some others around them were waving Islamist flags and banners? This secular activist had one of the Islamist banners waved right in front of him when he reached with his hands, folded it and threw it then continued singing and dancing and a few seconds after the Islamist banner was raised again!

Have you known anything about Syria before the war? Wasnt Syria a peaceful country and in a way Europe was little safer (no refugees and its issues)\n\nYou mentioned countries that are pro western that the media did not even care much for, not many people know of them, the so called Arab spring was supposedly about democracy and freedom and non of those countries are now democratic or better then they were before... Funny you didn't bring up Bahrain, since it is western puppet country the media barely covered it... And the Yemen crisis, not a single UN security council resolution to condemn alsaud, however when it came to Syria, a country that does not kneel to the west, resolutions to attack Syria were plenty, thankfully Russia and China were there to veto...\n\nI don't want to even mention Afghanistan and Iraq, isis was created because of Iraq invasion and isis grew stronger thanks to the western support they provided to the so called rebels who worked hand in hand with isis and Alqaeda... \n\nI'm sick and tired of hearing how all this was caused because of the Syrian government, the Syrian government did what other governments would act to armed groups... Imagine doing that in Europe, you think the government would sit idly and let terrorists takeover? \n\nHeck all this was planned years before, general Clark said it. The ex French foreign minister himself admitted there was planning to destroy Syria feel free to look them up. \n\nLook, this war is not about democracy or human rights, it is about toppling sovereign nations that is not in the western camp... And the countries you listed are the best example as they are still not even close to being democratic...\n\nHmmm makes me wonder why the so called the Arab Spring never reached Palestine, they are the ones in most of need for it since they are under oppression and occupation... But that's a different story...""The reason I asked if you knew anything about Syria before the war, because Syrians (before the war) lived like kings compared to the countries you mentioned. Syrians had all their basic needs from free healthcare to free education and most importantly safety, [look at Syria 2010 peace index, it was better than some of the western countries](http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index). Syrians did not have to worry about putting food on the table, Syria was self sufficient when it came to agriculture at least... Corruption is every where, even in Europe and the US, Syria is not an exception when it comes to corruption, specially in the middle east.  \n\nThe idea that you have about Syria is not from your own experience, it is something that you have been told, and unfortunately you don't have a choice on news from Syria, as the MSM in Europe or in the west in general were mostly anti-Syria, you have the idea that the Syrian government is the bad guy, but I tell you what, the Syrian government is an angel compared to the alternative which was Islamism and wahabbism. \nThe issue with the west, is the double standard, look at the US and European allies in the region, why doesn't the west want their allies to be democratic? they only want Syria to be democratic but not Saudi Arabia...? this is the joke my friend..  The west wants to preach democracy, okay good, then it should start with its own allies.... \n\nWhen the protests started, the government made so many reforms, I'm pretty sure your MSM did not tell you, because it did not fit their agenda... starting with removing the emergency law, allowing new political parties and new constitution and etc... Democracy does not happen over night, with all these reforms they were the right steps, it just needed time, majority of Syrian supported these changes, until the west started to see their plan to remove the government is failing since the government is fulfilling the basic demands. they started beating the war drums and creating chaos and encouraged warfare... weapons were already in the hands of certain groups, tunnels were made BEFORE THE WAR between Syria (Homs) and Lebanon to transport weapons to the western backed groups, the governor of Homs was part of the scheme and he sold his country for $$$, of course when it all started he escaped because he knew what was about to happen. \n\nTrust me, this so called revolution was not genuine, it was not made in Syria. The west have been trying for years to topple the government of Syria, and it tried in so many ways, and they thought they could it through the Arab Springs, they tested it out in Libya and thought they were successful there, so it will also work in Syria... one of the attempt was an actual invasion of Syria ([Clark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw)), to destroy it and install a weaker puppet government... \n[Roland Dumas: The British prepared for war in Syria 2 years before the eruption of the crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeyRwFHR8WY)\n\nwhen will the west learn from its mistakes, wasn't Afghanistan and Iraq enough? now look at Libya, can you say the people of Libya are now enjoying democracy and peace? Libyans had good, the Libyan government provided a lot to its small population of 6 million people, almost everything, literally, you want to get married? the Libyan government will cover your wedding expenses, Libyans themselves told me that. But why Gaddafi was toppled? Gaddafi talked to much and he knew a lot of stuff he shouldn't know about Europeans leaders (hint Sarkozy leading the effort to attack Libya)... His ideas of unifying Arabs and using one currency for all the Arabs scared the euro and the dollar... that's just one reason of course... I don't want to get off topic... \n\nAgain, Europe and the US claims to care about Syrians, yet they have sanctions against Syria... you think these Sanctions are hurting Alasad?? these sanction are only hurting the average Syrian... \n\nIt is funny that the west wants to ignore the majority of Syrian that actually support and stand behind their government. the west must acknowledges that Syrian government has the support of the majority of Syrians...\n\nI know a lot of people in Europe and the US getting tired of hearing it is the western fault... but that's the reality... yes Syria had a lot of issues, but nothing that can't be fixed... the west were so quick on saying Alasad must be removed that it only encouraged some to fight on and in the end it only caused chaos...  and what really makes it worse, is the double standards of the west... \n\n\n\n\n""Take care!""I honestly don't think they would work with regime and be side by side with the Iranians.""Everyone wants a piece of the cake, the Dutch like most of European and NATO countries thought that thry will topple the Syrian government, and so they will have access to Syria under the newly installed puppet government... For example, Libya is paying France and the UK for destroying Libya... ""Probably just dissidents, I doubt that those responsible don't have their neighbours interests at hand after everything that happened. \nProbably a minority.

Would take decades for the scars to scab over.\nI doubt those who sprayed that all over the walls were anti gov combatants and even if they were , they should really count their blessings at this point consider the amnesty they received to return back to normal life.""Nobody said the regime of the Assad dynasty were angels, even the most pro regime elements of this sub would be foolish to come to a conclusion like that.\n\nHowever, overthrowing his regime and replacing it with with Islamists sectarianists in a diverse country like Syria would spell genocide. \nThis civil war for all intents and purposes is black&amp;white. \n\nIt's a fact that many Syrians ask themselves, even if a lot of them are not involved. It's a fact that the Syrian regime would love you if you're loyal to it, they don't care about your religious affiliation or ethnicity, the alternative is sever personal repression. If you're a minority you might either be isolated or forced to become something that you don't want to. Or if you're deemed majoos, or rafidah or Nusayri they'll wipe you out. They wouldn't give you the chance to say the shahada.\n\nIt's a lot like saying white people  would benefit through a nazi regime, the reality says otherwise. They suffered differently. \n\nBottom line is, if you aren't with the regime in Syria, you're either in the SDF or sympathetic towards those fighting the regime. \nThere are no shades.""How is this remotely off-topic? It directly relates to Syria's relations with an external power which developed during the war and a market for Syrian products in the Caucasus, Russia and Europe which will affect the post-war economic recovery.\n\nWhere is this sudden need to shut down such topics coming from when they have been posted throughout for years? Who is being harmed? Many are interested in this news.\n\n""As I said, the country's economic relations with others has always been posted on here for years, trade deals and such. This is wholly arbitrary.""I don't think so, they probably have a lot of weapons cache's lying around for another uprising.\nCommanders and smugglers are dangerous, even in civilian life, I'd be worried when they start rounding up small fries who took up arms against the regime. Primarily the young men who surrendered.""Remember that dubious claim that the regime hacked up civilians in Homs during the insurrection? Both claims are dubious.\nEven more dubious that he escaped too apparently.\n\nI suppose you'd believe Iraqi armed forces stealing baby incubators and killing them in Kuwait too.\nIt's just sensational media. \nTake everything with a grain salt.""What evidence is there to support that besides whitness testimonies? \n\nPeople do get tortured in Syria in a daily, Syrian prisons are horrible. So horrible that the US would ship suspected terrorists or terrorists to Syria to extract information from them.\n\nOr what about that kid in Syria that had rubble all over him during the siege of Aleppo?\nTurns out he wasn't in rebel held territory.\n\n""Such activities will keep reoccurring, the next one will probably be burning of Alasad picture... In the end I hope they won't able to do more than slogans and burning pictures... \n\n""They're just slurs for shias and Alawites.\nBy calling them Persian or Zoroastrians. ""Not really, many claims of wrong doing by the regime was wide spread.\n\nLike the hacking up of people in the street, there was video evidence of that by the way and it did happen and the regime did get blamed for it, turns out it wasn't them either.\n\nA lot of testimonies were brought to the UN. Hell the rebels tried disguising their dead as unarmed civilians to provoke an invasion.\n""Amnesty doesn't exempt individuals from crimes they have committed. \n\nThey're targeting officers for obvious reasons, regular rebel foot soldiers, not so much.""Interesting read...

""That's the thing, when other attacks happen they immediately say it was chemical attack done by the Syrian government, without any proper evidence... ""You comparing two news outlets that nobody reads in the west to MSM mostly blaming the government... That is no match... \n\nOkay forget the media, how come almost no western government condemned the attack, it doesn't matter who did it... However when it fits their agenda they will quickly beat the war drum...""Yes, and my main point is the double standard, when an attack happens in rebel area, Syrian government is quickly blamed without any evidence, and the western governments will be issuing statements and such... Now why aren't they issuing a statement? ""let's start with the most recent attack that the US, France and UK responded with force...  Russia provided multiple evidence, and even brought victims of the attack to the Hague, Netherlands...  The west evidence? Were mainly media and eye witness reports... They didn't even wait for OPCW to investigate, and when OPCW wanted to enter the US delayed their entry with the strikes...""&gt;Russia uses video games sometimes as evidence\n\nI was referring to specific incident... And it brought the victims and doctors there were in the video to Netherlands... Why did the western governments refuse to meet with them? ""I'm talking about the 2018 Douma attack""Well... Don't you think part of a crime investigation is to interview the victims and the doctors there were treating the victims? They victims and doctors were brought to Europe, and the US along with European countries refused to meet with them... Does that make any sense ?? \n\n""And again, why we are not hearing war drums ? Chlorine in Douma and chlorine in this Aleppo attack, so what's the difference... The US didn't even wait for the OPCW results""From what I saw and heard, few ministers caught the attention of the social media, they were disliked for their way of managing things and some for silly corruption.. now the most interesting part is replacing minister of interior, this rarely happens""Are they just a bunch of butt hurt Syrian exiles or do they have actual men in the ground? They're behaving like a political opposition but they don't really have a say in Syria politicals.""I'd like to know more about them,  I'm not familiar with the names. Could you send links?""They jumped shipped to the Kurds when their FSA and regulars stopped being productive. ""I think they do.\nA lot of westerners volunteered to fight for the cause. Wouldn't surprise me if the Kurds had a favourable view of Americans. \nI think they should be wary of the US. The only guarantor that shit isn't going to happen to them is the regime occupying their territory. \n\nTurkey wouldn't invade Syria.\nOr at least attack the regime of Bashar Assad. ""For those who are interested in learning more and helping: \n\n[https://syria.acninternational.org/](https://syria.acninternational.org/)""Wait, how and why?""I don't think it would take generations to rebuild, I so think it would take generations for scabs to heal.""You made some really good points. Take some opposition upvotes. Those are special.""In other words, western sanctions are equal to terrorism, economic terrorism...""You think sanctions are only prohibiting sales? It prohibited everything and it is impacting the average civilians..\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-sanctions/syria-sanctions-indirectly-hit-childrens-cancer-treatment-idUSKBN16M1UW\n\nI said economic terrorism, but since you mentioned it, an exploding bomb could be a quick death, but sanctions could give you slow suffering life...""Oh the double standard... The Syrian government invited Russia and Iran also...""Isis is not different from saudi, they both follow the same idealogy... Beheading and etc... Isis only takes it to the extreme with their media, hence why people know of isis and not Saudi beheading""Sanctions mean no banking and you not allowed to do anything in Syria not just sales... I provided you with a link of have kids with cancer are impacted with sanctions... \n\nI thought the US policy is about making people lives better, so how are sanctions making the people lives better? These sanctions actually give the Syrian government more power to control and play the card that the US is hurting you people.. you think the average Syrians citizen love these sanctions?""&gt;attacks on civilians that Saudi Arabia lacks.\n\nWell Saudi funds group that it does that, and then you have the whole story of Yemen... ""Yes and No, but finding a workaround is not easy, otherwise these sanctions are meaningless... If there is a network that tries to get around they will also be sanctioned, most recently with Syria and Iran buying oil and using Russian bank... ""Oh man you really need to study sanctions, they are not as simple as you think... ""Didn't you say these sanctions are not harsh? That tells me you don't know much...\n\nThese sanctions are basically complete isolation of Syria, Syria can only work with Iran because they are already sanctioned and Russia which guess what? Are already sanctioned.... Even Syria's neighbors are following through with sanctions because if they don't they will also be sanctioned...""How? Iran is sanctioned and it is having the same issue as Syria for medical equipment... Russia is also sanctioned and their banks don't want to be sanctioned, if they transfer anything through their banks ( payments) or of they ship it they will face sanctions, that's what sanctions mean. If you do any business with sanctioned country you will also be sanctioned""Weapons are made by Russia and iran they are not providing Syria with US made weapons, so when Iran sends Syria weapons it is doing through government which are already sanctioned... ""Yeah, Iran and Syria has been under sanctions since 80\u2019s... I don't about Russia medical equipment""Well, if knowledge is shared then sure it is not a problem. But you need money and equipment even for R&amp;D... Heck Syria and Iran can both make X-ray machines but they need to buy parts, but no one wants to work them since they are sanctioned... You think it is so easy go make a medicine, well a lot of countries work together, but when Syria is sanctioned who is going to work with Syria? \n\nSyria does not lack X-ray machines, of Syria can have financial sanctions lifted (banking systems) then it can do what it needs to do""&gt;SYRIA just bought s-400 and s-300 for how much money\n\nSyria bought S-400???. And I think the S-300 Syria bought were on loan, basically Syria didn't pay for it yet, but they will in future.\n\nMaking medicine is not impossible if you have sanctions lifted. Why can't you understand that with sanctions on Syria it can't trade not just financially, but scientifically also. \nSyria makes it's own medicine, but it also needs to buy some, just like every country on Earth does... You are over simplifying things... \n\n""Or is ISIS just Saudi Arabia lite? Add a bit more sadism to the mix and it gets close. Totally sectarian theocratic states. ""Remind Me! 1 day.""wtf""Pretty sure Gaddafi said some of those things himself if he was to be ousted out of power, a lot of these revolutions weren't organic, you don't have to be a genius to figure that out.\n\nLook at the dissidents that left Syria. They were never popular. They always talk about reform and change and etc. They had existed before 2011 and they never gained traction. \n""just take Idlib already and ger over it.""Can someone explain what happened with Israeli strike on Syria earlier this week? There are many reports which contradicts each other and I didn't understand what happened."
