Incompetent and unmotivated fighters are leading the ground offensive on the SDF side while ISIS has nowhere left to run and will stand and fight. For political reasons the SDF does not have much armored support apart of a few MRAPs. Also for political reasons the offensive was delayed for quite some time which gave ISIS time to dig in, fortify and mine the area.""&gt; They just don't want to.

On top of that there is the problem with the \"group\" unit which tells us absolutely nothing about the relative size of a unit. The Taha regiment which was one of the two most active and prominent Tiger subgroups in recent history looks comparatively small on this graph, even though they are probably one of the largest groups.""It was just a matter of time until the ceasefire falls apart right from the start.
